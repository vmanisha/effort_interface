The most serious fall injury is hip fracture; one half of all older adults hospitalized for hip fracture neverregain their former level of function. In 1996, a total of 340,000 hospitalizations for hipfracture occurred among persons aged <u>&gt;</u>65 years, and 80% of these admissionsoccurred among women. From 1988 to 1996, hip fracture hospitalization rates for womenaged <u>&gt;</u>65 years increased 23%.</p><p><b>Etiologic or Risk Factors</b>: Risk factors for falls include increasing age, muscleweakness, functional limitations, environmental hazards, use of psychoactive medications, anda history of falls. Age is also a risk factor for hip fracture. Women aged<u>&gt;</u>85 years are nearly eight times more likely than women aged 65-74 years to be hospitalized forhip fracture. White women aged <u>&gt;</u>65 years are at higher risk for hip fracture thanblack women. Other risk factors for hip fracture include lack of physical activity,osteoporosis, low body mass index, and a previous hip fracture.</p><p><b>Recommendations for Prevention</b>: Because approximately 95% of hip fracturesresult from falls, minimizing fall risk is a practical approach to reducing these seriousinjuries. Research demonstrates that effective fall prevention strategies require amultifaceted approach with both behavioral and environmental components. Importantelements include education and skill building to increase knowledge about fall riskfactors, exercise to improve strength and balance, home modifications to reduce fallhazards, and medication assessment to minimize side effects (e.g., dizziness and grogginess).</p><p><b>Program and Research Needs</b>: Coordination needs to be improved among thediverse Federal, state, and local organizations that conduct fall prevention activities.The effectiveness of existing fall prevention programs among specific groups ofwomen (e.g., those aged <u>&gt;</u>85 years or living with functional limitations) needscareful evaluation. New primary fall prevention approaches are needed (e.g.,characterizing footwear that promotes stability), as well as secondary prevention strategies(e.g., protective hip pads) that can prevent injuries when falls occur. Finally, effortsare needed to increase collaboration among national experts from various disciplines,to reach consensus regarding priority research areas and program issues, and towork toward long-term strategies for reducing falls and fall-related injuries amongolder adults.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b>: Persons aged <u>&gt;</u>65 years constitute the fastest-growing segment of theU.S. population. Without effective intervention strategies, the number of hip fractureswill increase as the U.S. population ages. Fall prevention programs have reduced fallsand fall-related injuries among high-risk populations using multifaceted approachesthatinclude education, exercise, environmental modifications, and medicationreview. These programs need to be evaluated among older adults aged<u>&gt;</u>65 years who are living independently in the community. In addition, secondary prevention strategiesare needed to prevent hip fractures when falls occur. Effective public health strategiesneed to be implemented to promote behavioral changes, improve current interventions,and develop new fall prevention strategies to reduce future morbidity andmortality associated with hip fractures among older adults.</p><h3><b>BACKGROUND</b></h3><p>Older adults (i.e., persons aged <u>&gt;</u>65 years) are the fastest-growing segment ofthe U.S. population. In 1990, 13% of the population was aged<u>&gt;</u>65 years; by 2050, this proportion will nearly double to 23%(<i>1</i>). The number of persons aged <u>&gt;</u>65 years is projectedto increase from 31.0 million in 1990 to 68.1 million by 2040; for persons aged<u>&gt;</u>85 years, the relative growth is even faster(<i>1</i>). This report summarizes current knowledge aboutfalls and hip fracture among women aged <u>&gt;</u>65 years and describes both primary andsecondary strategies for preventing fall-related injuries. When discussing research results,the term &quot;significant&quot; refers to a documented p-value of p<u>&lt;</u> 0.05.</p><h3><b>SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM</b></h3><p>Falls are the leading cause of injury deaths and disabilities among persons aged<u>&gt;</u>65 years. In the United States, one of every three older adults falls each year(<i>2,3</i>). In 1997, nearly 9,000 persons aged<u>&gt;</u>65 years died from falls (<i>4</i>). Of those who fall, 20%-30% sustain moderate to severe injuries that reduce mobility and independence andincrease the risk for premature death (<i>5</i>). Older adults are hospitalized for fall-related injuriesfive times more often than they are for injuries from other causes(<i>5</i>), and women are nearly three times more likely than men to be hospitalized for a fall-related injury(<i>5</i>).</p><p>The most prevalent fall-related injuries among older adults are fractures of thehip; spine; upper arm; forearm; and bones of the pelvis, hand, and ankle(<i>6</i>). Of these, the most serious injury is hip fracture, a leading cause of morbidity and excessmortality among older adults (<i>7</i>). During 1988-1996, the estimated number of hospitaladmissions for hip fracture increased from 230,000 to 340,000 (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). In 1996, 80% of theadmissions for hip fracture occurred among women(<i>8</i>).</p><p>The rate of hospitalization for hip fracture differs by sex. The hip fracturehospitalization rate for persons aged <u>&gt;</u>65 years is significantly higher for women than men(<i>9</i>). During 1988-1996, the rates for women increased significantly, from 972 per 100,000to 1,356; for men, rates remained stable (<i>9</i>). A<i>Healthy People 2010</i> objective is to reduce the hip fracture hospitalization rate among women aged<u>&gt;</u>65 years to no more than 879 per 100,000 (objective 15-28a).</p><p>Hip fracture hospitalization rates are substantially higher for white women thanblack women. In 1996, the hospitalization rate for white women aged<u>&gt;</u>65 years was 1,174 per 100,000, five times the rate for black women(<i>9</i>). A <i>Healthy People 2010</i> objective isto reduce hip fracture hospitalization rates among white women aged<u>&gt;</u>65 years to no more than 932 per 100,000 (objective 15-28a).</p><p>The overall increase in hip fracture hospitalization rates can be explained in partby the increasing U.S. population of very old adults (i.e., persons aged<u>&gt;</u>85 years). Today, alarger proportion of the population is living to age<u>&gt;</u>85 years than in the past because of reduced mortality from cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. Since 1987,death rates from coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer have declined, and theproportion of adults aged <u>&gt;</u>70 years living with some functional limitation* has increased(<i>10</i>). Frail older adults are twice as likely to fall as healthier persons(<i>11</i>).</p><p>Hip fractures are expensive. A recent study documented that the cost of a hipfracture (including direct medical care, formal nonmedical care, and informal care providedby family and friends) was $16,300-$18,700 during the first year following the injury(<i>12</i>). In 1991, hip fracture accounted for an estimated $2.9 billion in Medicare costs(<i>13</i>). On the basis of the annual cost of hip fracture in 1984, an assumption that the average costwill remain constant, an inflation rate of 3%-5%, and the increasing number of hipfractures, the estimated total annual cost of hip fracture in the United States could reach$82-$240 billion by the year 2040 (<i>14</i>).</p><p>An even more important factor than the monetary cost of hip fracture is theinjury's impact on a person's life in the form of loss of independence and decreased quality oflife. Nationwide, only 50% of older adults hospitalized for hip fracture are able to returnhome or live independently after the injury(<i>15,16</i>).</p><h3><b>ETIOLOGIC OR RISK FACTORS</b></h3><p>Approximately 95% of hip fractures are caused by falls(<i>17</i>). Other causes include being knocked over and being injured in a motor-vehicle crash; &lt;2% of hip fracturesoccur spontaneously (e.g., as the result of a metabolic bone disease)(<i>17</i>). Not all falls are equally likely to cause hip fracture. Biomechanical studies have demonstrated that,although both bone strength and the force of the impact are important factors, the pointof impact must be on or near the hip for a fall to cause a hip fracture(<i>18</i>).</p><p>Many factors contribute to falls and subsequent fall injury. Fall risk increasesrapidly with advancing age for persons aged <u>&gt;</u>65 years(<i>19</i>). Other fall risk factors include lackof current or previous physical activity(<i>20,21</i>), muscle weakness or balance problemsthat can contribute both to the risk for falling and the inability to break the impact of afall (<i>2,22,23</i>), functional limitations (e.g., difficulty with activities of daily living such asdressing or bathing) (<i>22,24</i>), cognitive impairment or dementia(<i>2</i>), use of psychoactive medications (e.g., tranquilizers or antidepressants), some combinations of medications(<i>2,25</i>), environmental factors (e.g., tripping hazards)(<i>26</i>), having fallen previously (<i>27</i>),having more than one chronic disease (<i>28</i>), having had a stroke(<i>28</i>), Parkinson disease (<i>29</i>) or a neuromuscular disease(<i>30</i>), urinary incontinence (<i>31</i>), and visual difficulties(<i>32,33</i>). Less clear is the fall risk associated with wearing shoes with thick, soft soles (e.g.,jogging shoes) that can affect balance and proprioception or become a tripping hazardby catching in carpeting (<i>34</i>).</p><p>Similar to fall risk, hip fracture risk increases sharply with advancing age(<i>19</i>). Women aged <u>&gt;</u>85 years are nearly eight times more likely than women aged65-74 years tobe hospitalized for hip fracture (<i>9</i>). White women aged<u>&gt;</u>65 years are at higher risk for hip fracture(<i>19</i>) than black women, in part because the prevalence and severity ofosteoporosis -- a condition that predisposes to bone fragility -- is greatest amongwhite women. Other risk factors include low body mass index (weight in kilograms dividedby height in meters squared [weight [kg]/height squared[m<sup>2</sup>]) (<i>7,35,36</i>), previous historyof osteoporosis (<i>27</i>), and having sustained a previous hip fracture(<i>27</i>).</p><p>Falls are caused by personal (intrinsic) and environmental (extrinsic) factors.Personal risk factors include problems with gait and balance, functional impairmentsor limitations in activities of daily living, visual problems, and behavioral risk factors(e.g., lack of physical activity and taking certain psychoactive medications such astranquillizers or antidepressants). Environmental factors include home hazards (e.g., clutter;no stair railings; loose rugs or other tripping hazards; no grab bars in the bathroom; andpoor lighting, especially on stairs). Frequently, a fall is the result of an interactionbetween personal and environmental factors.</p><h3><b>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PREVENTION </b></h3><p>Because approximately 95% of hip fractures result from falls(<i>17</i>), minimizing fall risk is a practical approach to reducing these serious injuries. Primary prevention offall-related injuries involves reducing the occurrence of falls; secondary prevention offall-related injuries involves preventing injuries when falls occur.</p><h3><b>Primary Prevention</b></h3><p>Primary prevention of fall-related injuries among older adults can be targetedto persons living independently in the community or residents of nursing homes.Research has established that effective fall intervention programs employ a multifacetedapproach and incorporate both behavioral and environmental elements: exercises toimprove strength and balance, environmental modifications, education about fall prevention,medication review and assessment to minimize side effects, and risk factor reduction(<i>36-39</i>).</p><h4><b><i>Community Intervention</i></b></h4><p>Approximately 90% of adults aged <u>&gt;</u>65 years live in the community and manyfall prevention programs target these persons; however, few of these programs havebeen evaluated for effectiveness. During 1990-1992, a prospective, multifaceted, fall-prevention study was conducted among 301 community-dwelling men and womenwho were aged <u>&gt;</u>70 years and had at least one fall risk factor (e.g., sedative use orsome limitation in arm or leg strength) (<i>36</i>). A total of 153 persons participated in anintervention that consisted of behavioral instructions and training to reduce specific riskfactors (e.g., persons with gait or balance impairments received specialized training inthese areas), exercise programs to increase strength, and medication adjustments. After1 year, the group that received the intervention had 30% fewer falls than the controlgroup. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of such a program amongall persons aged <u>&gt;</u>65 years living independently in the community.</p><p><b>Physical Activity.</b> Increasing physical activity can be an effective component offall prevention programs. Activities that improve strength, balance, and coordinationcan reduce the risk for falls and fall-related injuries among healthy(<i>40,41</i>) and frail persons (<i>42</i>). Studies have demonstrated a40%-60% reduction in hip fracture risk withincreasing levels of physical activity(<i>36,43</i>). Although fall prevention programs havefocused on several techniques to improve strength, balance, coordination, mobility, andflexibility, Tai Chi is probably the most frequently studied type of exercise(<i>40</i>). Effective programs have been employed with persons of different ages and with varied physicalabilities;however, persons with functional limitations might require more individualizedphysical activity programs (<i>44</i>).</p><p><b>Environmental Modifications.</b> Because approximately 50%-60% of all fallsamong older adults occur at home, fall prevention programs should address home hazardsthat can contribute to falls (<i>45</i>). Home-visiting programs (e.g., those using visitingnurses) provide opportunities to identify potential fall hazards and take corrective action.These programs can increase awareness of fall risks among informal caregivers, (e.g.,family and friends who frequently visit the homes of older adults) and the older adultsthemselves.</p><p><b>Health Education.</b> Fall prevention programs frequently includehealth education and health promotion materials about reducing fall hazards that are distributed atcentral locations (e.g., senior centers or health fairs). However, educational materialsalone might not promote behavioral changes. Many programs employ home-hazardchecklists that can be used by the caregiver or health agency personnel (e.g., a visiting nurseor home health aide) to help persons identify fall hazards and to suggest correctiveaction (e.g., eliminating potential tripping hazards such as clutter and throw rugs, addingstair railings, improving lighting, adding nonslip floor surfaces, and installing grab barsin bathrooms). Checklists are also given to residents to help them assess personaland environmental risks and take preventive action, including behavioral changes(<i>45</i>). Research is needed to evaluate and assess the effectiveness of educational materialsand home-hazard checklists to promote fall-risk reduction activities and behaviors.</p><p><b>Risk Factor Reduction.</b> Approaches that address specific risk factors cansupplement fall prevention program efforts. Medical approaches might include reducing fallrisk factors (e.g., maximizing control of concomitant chronic diseases) and reducing hipfracture risk factors (e.g., counseling women aged<u>&gt;</u>65 years against inappropriate weight loss).</p><h4><b><i>Nursing-Home Intervention</i></b></h4><p>Nursing-home residents, who constitute approximately 5% of the populationaged <u>&gt;</u>65 years, are at particularly high risk for fall-related injuries. Approximately one halfof the estimated 1.7 million nursing-home residents in the United States fall at leastonce each year, and 11% sustain a serious fall-related injury(<i>46</i>). A randomized trial of seven pairs of nursing homes that included 500 residents evaluated an intensive,multifaceted intervention of extensive environmental modifications (e.g., obtaining wheel locksfor beds, changing lighting, modifying floor plans, and purchasing raised toilet seats),medication review, and increased attention to individual resident needs(<i>39</i>). Repeat falls declined 19% among nursing-home residents who had fallen at least once duringthe previous year. However, approximately one third of the safety recommendationsimplemented in the study group were discontinued within 3 months of the completion ofthe study. Strategies are needed to institutionalize fall prevention interventions in thenursing-home setting, and additional programs designed for high-risk nursing-homeresidents need to be implemented and evaluated.</p><h3><b>Secondary Prevention</b></h3><p>Secondary prevention strategies are being developed to reduce the incidence ofhip fracture among older women (<i>47</i>). Most hip fractures are caused by falling directlyon the hip, and biomechanical studies have demonstrated that a pad that shunts theenergyaway from the point of impact is highly effective in reducing the force of a fall onthe proximal femur (<i>48</i>). A 1993 clinical study in a Copenhagen nursing homedemonstrated that hip protectors reduced the risk for hip fracture by approximately 50%(<i>47</i>). During 1994-1996, researchers in Finland conducted a study to determine whethernursing-home residents would wear an undergarment with energy-shunting hip pads. Thefindings indicated that 63% of the residents wore the pads(<i>49</i>). U.S. manufacturers have considered producing and marketing an undergarment with energy-absorbing hippads, but how acceptable and effective this garment might be amongcommunity-dwelling older adults is unknown.</p><p>A promising technologic innovation for preventing fall-related injuries is arecently developed safety floor (<i>50</i>). Under laboratory conditions, this flooring materialprovides a firm walking surface and, if a fall occurs, reduces the force of impact through the useof special energy-absorbing flooring material. Field trials are under way in nursinghomes to evaluate the effectiveness of this material in preventing fall-related hipfractures among nursing-home residents.</p><h3><b>PROGRAM AND RESEARCH AGENDA</b></h3><p>Many professional and community-level organizations within the public healthcommunity, federal agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and state and localhealth departments are involved in efforts to reduce falls and fall-related injuries amongolder adults. However, coordination among these entities has been limited. CDC'sNational Center for Injury Prevention and Control has funded the National Resource Centeron Aging and Injury at San Diego State University to collect, organize, and evaluateinformation and to increase awareness about preventing unintentional injuries amongolder adults. Information will be available through fact sheets, formal publications, andthe Internet (at &lt;<a href="http://www.olderadultinjury.org">http://www.olderadultinjury.org</a>&gt;) and will be provided to health-careprofessionals, caretakers, and other persons concerned about reducing injuriesamong older adults.</p><p>Researchers do not know all the factors that contribute to falls and fall-relatedinjuries or how personal and environmental factors interact to cause a fall. These factorshave been difficult to identify because persons frequently cannot explain the causes orcircumstances surrounding fall events. In one prospective study, one fourth to one thirdof the participants did not remember a fall that occurred 36 months earlier(<i>51</i>). Older adults might either blame themselves for falling or consider falls to be aninevitable consequence of the aging process. Longitudinal prospective studies are needed toaccurately assess the associations between fall risk factors (e.g., interactions betweenintrinsic and extrinsic factors), the occurrence of falls, and fall outcomes (e.g., frequencyof falls, whether an injury results, and level of injury severity).</p><p>To decrease the incidence and severity of fall-related injuries, injury-preventionprograms for older adults need to integrate research findings into multifaceted,community-level programs that include both implementation and evaluation components. Amodel program would employ a prospective design to accurately record fall occurrencesand establish whether a fall resulted in an injury. Such a program should incorporatefour critical elements: a) education and skill-building activities to increase knowledgeabout fall risk factors, b) exercise to increase strength and improve balance, c) homesafety modifications and repairs to reduce fall hazards, and d) medication review tomaximizecontrol of comorbid conditions while reducing adverse side effects. Becausepersons must take an active role to reduce their risk for falling, a model fall preventionprogram should also include effective strategies to promote behavioral changes.</p><p>Because of the increasing number of persons aged<u>&gt;</u>65 years in the United States, the need is increasing to develop an effective national plan to address the problem offalls and fall-related injuries within the constraints of limited health-care resources. Toaccomplish this goal, efforts are needed to increase collaboration among national expertsfrom various disciplines (e.g., gerontologists, health educators, behavioralepidemiologists, home designers, and ergonomic experts), to reach consensus regarding thepriority research areas and program issues, and to work toward long-term strategies forreducing falls and fall-related injuries among older adults.</p><p>Some subgroups of older adults (e.g., women aged<u>&gt;</u>85 years and older adults with functional limitations) might have different fall-injury risks than most community-dwelling older adults (<i>44</i>). Efforts are needed to adapt existing fall preventionprograms or develop new interventions to reduce falls in these groups. Finally, in addition toexisting behavioral and environmental interventions, new fall prevention approaches(e.g., characterizing footwear that promotes stability and developing more effectivehome lighting) need to be developed.</p><h3><b>CONCLUSION</b></h3><p>Persons aged <u>&gt;</u>65 years constitute the fastest-growing segment of the U.S.population. The average life expectancy for both men and women is increasing, in partbecause of healthier life styles and better control and treatment of chronic conditions (e.g.,cardiovascular disease). Without effective intervention strategies, the number of hipfractures will increase as the U.S. population ages.</p><p>Fall prevention programs have effectively reduced falls in select populations by30%-50%, using multifaceted approaches that include various combinations ofeducation, exercise, medication assessment, risk factor reduction, and environmentalmodifications. Such programs need to be expanded to include multiple interventioncomponents tailored for diverse populations of older adults and evaluated for effectiveness. Inaddition, secondary prevention strategies (e.g., reducing the amount of energy transferredto the hip) are needed to prevent hip fracture when falls occur.</p><p>The problem of fall-related hip fractures will continue to increase unlesseffective intervention strategies are developed and implemented to improve fall preventioninterventions and expand existing programs. Older adults must take an active role inreducing their risk for falling. Because most older adults live independently, fall preventionprograms must include effective strategies to promote behavioral changes. Innovativeand effective fall prevention strategies are needed to reduce future morbidity andmortality associated with hip fractures, increase independence, and improve quality of life forthe growing number of older adults.</p><h3>References</h3> <ol> <li> US Bureau of the Census.

Although most jurisdictions recognize paralegals to a greater or lesser extent, there is no international consistency as to definition, job-role, status, terms and conditions of employment, training, regulation or anything else and so each jurisdiction must be looked at individually.</p> <table id="toc" class="toc" summary="Contents"> <tbody> <tr> <td> <div id="toctitle"> <h2>Contents</h2> </div> <ul> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Official_definitions"><span class="tocnumber">1</span> <span class="toctext">Official definitions</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Difference_between_paralegals_and_lawyers"><span class="tocnumber">2</span> <span class="toctext">Difference between paralegals and lawyers</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Difference_between_paralegals_and_notaries_public"><span class="tocnumber">3</span> <span class="toctext">Difference between paralegals and notaries public</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Educational_background"><span class="tocnumber">4</span> <span class="toctext">Educational background</span></a> <ul> <li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#United_States"><span class="tocnumber">4.1</span> <span class="toctext">United States</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#United_Kingdom"><span class="tocnumber">4.2</span> <span class="toctext">United Kingdom</span></a></li> </ul></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Certification"><span class="tocnumber">5</span> <span class="toctext">Certification</span></a> <ul> <li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#United_States_2"><span class="tocnumber">5.1</span> <span class="toctext">United States</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#United_Kingdom_2"><span class="tocnumber">5.2</span> <span class="toctext">United Kingdom</span></a></li> </ul></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Salary"><span class="tocnumber">6</span> <span class="toctext">Salary</span></a> <ul> <li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#United_States_3"><span class="tocnumber">6.1</span> <span class="toctext">United States</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#United_Kingdom_3"><span class="tocnumber">6.2</span> <span class="toctext">United Kingdom</span></a></li> </ul></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Economics"><span class="tocnumber">7</span> <span class="toctext">Economics</span></a> <ul> <li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#United_States_4"><span class="tocnumber">7.1</span> <span class="toctext">United States</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#United_Kingdom_4"><span class="tocnumber">7.2</span> <span class="toctext">United Kingdom</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#Trends_in_usage_of_paralegals"><span class="tocnumber">7.3</span> <span class="toctext">Trends in usage of paralegals</span></a></li> </ul></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Paralegal_Nurse_Consultants"><span class="tocnumber">8</span> <span class="toctext">Paralegal Nurse Consultants</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Paralegal_Day"><span class="tocnumber">9</span> <span class="toctext">Paralegal Day</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Paralegals_outside_of_the_United_States"><span class="tocnumber">10</span> <span class="toctext">Paralegals outside of the United States</span></a> <ul> <li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#United_Kingdom_5"><span class="tocnumber">10.1</span> <span class="toctext">United Kingdom</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#Canada"><span class="tocnumber">10.2</span> <span class="toctext">Canada</span></a></li> </ul></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Paralegals_in_television_and_literature"><span class="tocnumber">11</span> <span class="toctext">Paralegals in television and literature</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#See_also"><span class="tocnumber">12</span> <span class="toctext">See also</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#References"><span class="tocnumber">13</span> <span class="toctext">References</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#External_links"><span class="tocnumber">14</span> <span class="toctext">External links</span></a></li> </ul></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[ if (window.showTocToggle) { var tocShowText = "show"; var tocHideText = "hide"; showTocToggle(); } //]]></script> <p><a name="Official_definitions" id="Official_definitions"></a></p> <h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Paralegal&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" title="Edit section: Official definitions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Official definitions</span></h2> <p>Various legal organizations offer official definitions of a paralegal: these definitions typically have slight differences. Definitions offered by major organizations include:</p> <ul> <li>From the United Kingdom's Institute of Paralegals: &quot;A paralegal is a non-lawyer who does legal work that previously would have been done by a lawyer, or if done by a lawyer, would be charged for.&quot;</li> <li>From the <a href="/wiki/American_Bar_Association" title="American Bar Association">American Bar Association</a>: &quot;A legal assistant or paralegal is a person qualified by education, training or work experience who is employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental agency or other entity who performs specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is responsible.&quot; Under this definition, the legal responsibility for a paralegal's work rests directly and solely upon the lawyer.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></li> <li>From the National Federation of Paralegal Associations (NFPA) [USA]: &quot;A Paralegal is a person, qualified through education, training or work experience to perform substantive legal work that requires knowledge of legal concepts and is customarily, but not exclusively, performed by a lawyer. This person may be retained or employed by a lawyer, law office, governmental agency or other entity or may be authorized by administrative, statutory or court authority to perform this work.

Through formal education, training and experience, legal assistants have knowledge and expertise regarding the legal system and substantive and procedural law which qualify them to do work of a legal nature under the supervision of an attorney.&quot; In 2001, NALA adopted the ABA's definition of a paralegal or legal assistant as an addition to its definition.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></li> <li>From the American Association for Paralegal Education (AAfPE): &quot;Paralegals perform substantive and procedural legal work as authorized by law, which work, in the absence of the paralegal, would be performed by an attorney.

If a paralegal attempts to do this they will be in violation the &quot;Unathorized Practice of Law&quot; (UPL).</p> <p>Other traditional differences between a paralegal and a lawyer (e.g. an attorney in the United States; a <a href="/wiki/Solicitor" title="Solicitor">solicitor</a> or <a href="/wiki/Barrister" title="Barrister">barrister</a> in the UK or solicitor or <a href="/wiki/Advocate" title="Advocate">advocate</a> in <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>) is that:</p> <ol> <li>paralegal expertise/training tends to be niche, whereas a lawyer has a much broader, longer, more formal and holistic training, and</li> <li>that the lawyer's primary job is to consider, analyse and strategise, whereas a paralegal's primary responsibility is to carry out the tasks arising from that consideration, analysis and strategy.</li> </ol> <p>However these distinctions are blurring: economic forces are pricing lawyers out of many areas of practice and paralegals are increasingly stepping in to fill the vacuum. How quickly and how far they are doing this varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In the UK there are now almost 4,000 government registered/regulated paralegal advisory firms offering services that would previously have been offered by lawyers. Elsewhere such as India and Singapore, paralegals work much more along the traditional line of assisting lawyers.</p> <p>Paralegals are found in all areas where lawyers work ��� in <a href="/wiki/Criminal_procedure" title="Criminal procedure">criminal trials</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Real_estate" title="Real estate">real estate</a>, in government, in <a href="/wiki/Estate_planning" title="Estate planning">estate planning</a>. In the US, paralegals and <a href="/wiki/Legal_document_assistant" title="Legal document assistant">legal document assistants</a> (LDAs) are often mistaken for one another. In most other jurisdictions the profession is not yet developed enough to have a clear distinction between the two.</p> <p>Paralegals continue to study more fields everyday, and now with some economic difficulties more people are relying on paralegals to offer more reasonably priced services.</p> <p><a name="Difference_between_paralegals_and_notaries_public" id="Difference_between_paralegals_and_notaries_public"></a></p> <h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Paralegal&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Difference between paralegals and notaries public">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Difference between paralegals and notaries public</span></h2> <p>In the United States a large percentage of paralegals and legal secretaries are also commissioned as <a href="/wiki/Notary_public" title="Notary public">notaries public</a>.

These paths comprise an array of varying levels of education, different certifications, and on-the-job-training. They work in government, for <a href="/wiki/Law_firm" title="Law firm">law firms</a>, for <a href="/wiki/Corporation" title="Corporation">corporations</a>, for real estate firms, and for nonprofit organizations. Where they work and what they do often depends on what mixture of experience, skills, education, and certification they possess.</p> <p>Some paralegals have only on-the-job experience, while some paralegals have completed a <a href="/wiki/Associate%27s_degree" title="Associate's degree">two-year course</a> or <a href="/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree" title="Bachelor's degree">bachelor's degree</a> in paralegal studies. Others have completed a bachelor's or even a <a href="/wiki/Master%27s_degree" title="Master's degree">master's degree</a> in another field, and quite a few of these people have also completed a regular or post-baccalaureate paralegal certificate. Many paralegals have completed all of their training before entering the profession, while others have completed their education while working their way up from the mailroom in a law firm. Many paralegals take Continuing Legal Education credits to fulfill the requirements of their firm, state, or association.</p> <p>Paralegal or Legal Assistant courses of study have long been available in associate's degree or certificate programs at community colleges and private universities. However, similar programs exist at four-year universities and have expanded over the years. More and more prestigious universities offer bachelor's degrees and post-baccalaureate certificates in the subject.</p> <p>There is generally no requirement in states for legal assistants or paralegals. California however is a major exception. Up until Business and professions code 6450 was signed into law by Governor <a href="/wiki/Gray_Davis" title="Gray Davis">Gray Davis</a> in 2000, there was little, if any regulation of paralegals in the state. Thus, many people would prepare legal documents for the public (even though it is understood that paralegals are not supposed to provide services directly to the public) and call themselves paralegals. In addition to the flurry of lawsuits filed against these individuals, the paralegal profession began to be attacked. This caused the paralegal community to demand that the paralegal profession in California be regulated. Now persons wishing to become paralegals must complete a 24 semester unit paralegal program at an accredited institution. <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p> <p><a name="United_Kingdom" id="United_Kingdom"></a></p> <h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Paralegal&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: United Kingdom">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">United Kingdom</span></h3> <p>The paralegal profession is one brought about primarily by economic development. When a country's economy become sufficiently developed so that law, compliance and regulation become everyday aspects of business life and the life of individuals' then the traditionally high-priced services of a lawyer, along with the traditional ways of delivering that service, become inappropriate in many circumstances. As a result paralegal professions are formed. Outside of the United States, the paralegal profession is only now forming. The United Kingdom is perhaps the most far advanced, but not by much.</p> <p>As a direct result of this, outside of the United States there are no formal routes, educational or otherwise, into the paralegal profession. Access is usually by direct entry from school, college or university followed by on-the-job-training. Frequently the paralegal option is a career option for ambitious senior legal secretaries. In the United Kingdom specialist paralegal training is now being offered although there is no recognised route one has to take. It is however a sign of the growing importance of paralegals that the world-famous University of Cambridge now offers online vocational paralegal training leading to a certificate in law from the University.</p> <p><a name="Certification" id="Certification"></a></p> <h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Paralegal&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: Certification">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Certification</span></h2> <p><a name="United_States_2" id="United_States_2"></a></p> <h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Paralegal&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: United States">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">United States</span></h3> <p>In the United States, there is no such thing as a <i>licensed</i> paralegal; rather, paralegals can be &quot;registered,&quot; &quot;certificated,&quot; or <i>certified</i>. While <a href="/wiki/Certification" title="Certification">certification</a> or registration is voluntary in most states, it prepares a paralegal to enter the profession, in many places it may increase the likelihood of a paralegal's hire or promotion, and serves to identify a person as capable of work that is on par with certain standards. There are two major <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">national</a> organizations that offer designations to paralegals who meet voluntary regulation standards: the <b>National Association of Legal Assistants</b> (NALA) and the <b>National Federation of Paralegal Associations</b> (NFPA). NALA offers its Certified Legal Assistant examination, a comprehensive 2-day examination that awards the paralegal the &quot;CLA&quot; or &quot;Certified Legal Assistant&quot; or &quot;CP&quot; Certified Paralegal&quot; designation. Both the &quot;CLA&quot; and &quot;CP&quot; designations are proprietary trademarks owned by NALA, paralegals who have attained further education and received a paralegal certificate are referred to as &quot;Certificated&quot; unless they have passed the examination and been awarded the &quot;Certified&quot; designation. Additionally, those paralegals who receive the &quot;Certified Paralegal&quot; designation then have the opportunity to earn the &quot;Advanced Certified Paralegal&quot; designation. The NFPA offers the Paralegal Advanced Competency Exam, which is a four-hour exam on a variety of legal topics; those who pass that exam can call themselves PACE-Registered Paralegals and display the &quot;RP&quot; designation.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p> <p>Graduation from a certificate or degree program does not, technically, certify a paralegal; in most states, passing an exam administered by a recognized entity is the only benchmark.

This is equally true of most other jurisdictions, many of whom exercise an even tighter control over access to the legal profession.</p> <p>As the cost of litigation has risen, insurance companies and other clients have increasingly refused to pay for a lawyer to perform these certain kinds of tasks, and this gap has been filled in many cases by paralegals.

This in turn makes lawyers more efficient by allowing them to concentrate solely on the substantive legal issues of the case, while paralegals have become the &quot;case managers.&quot;</p> <p>The United Kingdom has gone one step further. Much legal work by lawyers for the poorer elements of society is <a href="/wiki/Legal_aid" title="Legal aid">legally aided</a>, or paid for by the government. As overall costs have risen due to more people than ever engaging with the law, the government has reduced such legal aid.

Nonprofits rely on end-of-year donations to meet their budgets. While most Americans will not admit it, the IRS January 1st deadline encourages charitable gifts at the end of the year.</p> <p>24/7 Wall St. identified the 10 states where Americans give the most and least to charity, based on IRS data for charitable giving.</p> <p>24/7 Wall St. reviewed IRS data compiled by the Urban Institute, which reports on the most recent annual data available from the IRS every year. According to Katie Roeger, assistant program director at Urban Institute, “Only a handful of states saw increases in average donations in 2009. The increases came from both high-income states such as New York and Connecticut as well has lower-income states like Kansas or South Dakota.”</p> <div class="vine-p vine_data_M2_LayoutPrinter vine_data_M2_FlexiblePrinter base_printer_widgets_AdBreak"> <div class="adbreak"> <div class="vine-p vine_data_M2_LayoutPrinter vine_data_M2_FlexiblePrinter base_printer_widgets_InsertAd"> <div class="insertAd_Rectangle"> <div class="newsvinemsn_adtype" style="height:250px; width=300px;"> <div class="adlabel"> <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31066137/media-kit/" class="mediakit" target="_blank">Advertise</a> | <a href="http://g.msn.com/AIPRIV/en-us" class="adchoices" target="_blank">AdChoices</a> </div> <script type="text/javascript"> if (typeof(dapMgr) == 'undefined') { document.write('<scr'+'ipt type="text/javascript" src="http://ads1.msn.com/library/dapmsn.js"></scr'+'ipt>'); } </script> <script type="text/javascript">if (typeof(DeferView) == 'undefined') { document.write('<scr'+'ipt type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.lib.newsvine.com/_util/deferview/deferview.js?v=30"></scr'+'ipt>'); } </script> <div id="pgNBCMSN954034115" class="deferview_loadInViewport" data-callback="pgNBCMSN954034115"></div> <script type="text/javascript">if (typeof(DeferView) != 'undefined') { DeferView.registerCallback('pgNBCMSN954034115', function() { dapMgr.enableACB('pgNBCMSN954034115', false);dapMgr.renderAd('pgNBCMSN954034115', '&PG=NBCMSN&AP=1089&ONECLICK=1', 300, 250);});} else { dapMgr.enableACB('pgNBCMSN954034115', false);dapMgr.renderAd('pgNBCMSN954034115', '&PG=NBCMSN&AP=1089&ONECLICK=1', 300, 250);}</script> </div> </div> <div class="insertAd_adbreak3"> <div class="newsvinemsnsponsored_adtype" style="height:250px; width=300px;"> <script type="text/javascript"> if (typeof(dapMgr) == 'undefined') { document.write('<scr'+'ipt type="text/javascript" src="http://ads1.msn.com/library/dapmsn.js"></scr'+'ipt>'); } </script> <script type="text/javascript">if (typeof(DeferView) == 'undefined') { document.write('<scr'+'ipt type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.lib.newsvine.com/_util/deferview/deferview.js?v=30"></scr'+'ipt>'); } </script> <div id="pgNBCCAB1744104400" class="deferview_loadInViewport" data-callback="pgNBCCAB1744104400"></div> <script type="text/javascript">if (typeof(DeferView) != 'undefined') { DeferView.registerCallback('pgNBCCAB1744104400', function() { dapMgr.enableACB('pgNBCCAB1744104400', false);dapMgr.renderAd('pgNBCCAB1744104400', '&PG=NBCCAB&AP=1089&ONECLICK=1', 300, 250);});} else { dapMgr.enableACB('pgNBCCAB1744104400', false);dapMgr.renderAd('pgNBCCAB1744104400', '&PG=NBCCAB&AP=1089&ONECLICK=1', 300, 250);}</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p><a target="_blank" href="http://247wallst.com/2011/11/28/best-and-worst-run-states-in-america-an-analysis-of-all-50/">24/7 Wall St.: Best and Worst Run States in America</a></p> <p>The most generous states, for the most part, are also the wealthiest ones. Five of the 10 states that give the most to charity on a per taxpayer basis are among the top 10 states with the highest average income per taxpayer. There are also a number of relatively poor states that are generous, despite their low income. Alabama and Georgia have relatively low average incomes, but the average taxpayer gives more than taxpayers in other, wealthier states.</p> <p>A similar trend can be seen among the least generous states. Eight of the 10 states have incomes lower than the national average, and five of them are among the 15 states with the lowest income per taxpayer. At the same time, a few states appear to be less generous, despite their wealth. New Hampshire and Alaska taxpayers make more than the national average, and have more households that make over $200,000 than most other states, but taxpayers give less on average than other, poorer, states.</p> <p>24/7 Wall St. relied on Urban Institute’s methodology to determine the most charitable states. Using data collected by the IRS, the institute ranks each state by average charitable donation per taxpayer, highest to lowest. The number is calculated by dividing the total number of taxpayers in each state by the total charitable donations listed in itemized deductions for taxpayers.</p> <p>The IRS only keeps track of charitable donations filed by taxpayers as part of their itemized deductions. While charitable gifts that are not included in tax filings are not tracked by the IRS, they only account for approximately 15 percent to 20 percent of total annual charitable giving in the U.S each year, according to The Giving Institute. According to the Giving Institute’s Executive Director Geoffery Brown, because nonitemized deductions are not calculated at a state level, the Urban Institute’s methodology is a good proxy for the average charitable donations given per resident in a state.</p> <p>Profiles of Individual Charitable Contributions by State, the Urban Institute’s most recent report published this year, is based on IRS filings for 2009, filed in 2010. To reflect the extent to which wealth impacts charity, 24/7 Wall St. also included average adjusted gross income per taxpayer, as well as the percent of taxpayers reporting charitable donation, both from the Urban Institute. The percentage of households that earn more than $200,000 per year per state and poverty rates are from the Census Bureau. We relied on Convio’s list of the most generous cities in the U.S. for 2010, based on online donations per person, to demonstrate charitable giving on a local level.</p> <div class="vine-p vine_data_M2_LayoutPrinter vine_data_M2_FlexiblePrinter base_printer_widgets_AdBreak"> <div class="adbreak"> <div class="vine-p vine_data_M2_LayoutPrinter vine_data_M2_FlexiblePrinter base_printer_widgets_InsertAd"> <div class="insertAd_Rectangle"> <div class="newsvinemsn_adtype" style="height:250px; width=300px;"> <div class="adlabel"> <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31066137/media-kit/" class="mediakit" target="_blank">Advertise</a> | <a href="http://g.msn.com/AIPRIV/en-us" class="adchoices" target="_blank">AdChoices</a> </div> <script type="text/javascript"> if (typeof(dapMgr) == 'undefined') { document.write('<scr'+'ipt type="text/javascript" src="http://ads1.msn.com/library/dapmsn.js"></scr'+'ipt>'); } </script> <script type="text/javascript">if (typeof(DeferView) == 'undefined') { document.write('<scr'+'ipt type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.lib.newsvine.com/_util/deferview/deferview.js?v=30"></scr'+'ipt>'); } </script> <div id="pgNBCMSN1045441200" class="deferview_loadInViewport" data-callback="pgNBCMSN1045441200"></div> <script type="text/javascript">if (typeof(DeferView) != 'undefined') { DeferView.registerCallback('pgNBCMSN1045441200', function() { dapMgr.enableACB('pgNBCMSN1045441200', false);dapMgr.renderAd('pgNBCMSN1045441200', '&PG=NBCMSN&AP=1089&ONECLICK=1', 300, 250);});} else { dapMgr.enableACB('pgNBCMSN1045441200', false);dapMgr.renderAd('pgNBCMSN1045441200', '&PG=NBCMSN&AP=1089&ONECLICK=1', 300, 250);}</script> </div> </div> <div class="insertAd_adbreak3"> <div class="newsvinemsnsponsored_adtype" style="height:250px; width=300px;"> <script type="text/javascript"> if (typeof(dapMgr) == 'undefined') { document.write('<scr'+'ipt type="text/javascript" src="http://ads1.msn.com/library/dapmsn.js"></scr'+'ipt>'); } </script> <script type="text/javascript">if (typeof(DeferView) == 'undefined') { document.write('<scr'+'ipt type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.lib.newsvine.com/_util/deferview/deferview.js?v=30"></scr'+'ipt>'); } </script> <div id="pgNBCCAB1275996251" class="deferview_loadInViewport" data-callback="pgNBCCAB1275996251"></div> <script type="text/javascript">if (typeof(DeferView) != 'undefined') { DeferView.registerCallback('pgNBCCAB1275996251', function() { dapMgr.enableACB('pgNBCCAB1275996251', false);dapMgr.renderAd('pgNBCCAB1275996251', '&PG=NBCCAB&AP=1089&ONECLICK=1', 300, 250);});} else { dapMgr.enableACB('pgNBCCAB1275996251', false);dapMgr.renderAd('pgNBCCAB1275996251', '&PG=NBCCAB&AP=1089&ONECLICK=1', 300, 250);}</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p><strong>The Most Charitable States</strong></p> <p><strong>1.

Utah is by no means the wealthiest state as income per taxpayer is just $52,027, the 21st highest in the country. Only 2.8 percent&nbsp;of residents make $200,000 or more. Nevertheless, the average taxpayer donated a remarkable $2,388 per person to charity in 2009, $600, or roughly 40 percent&nbsp;more than the next highest state.</p> <p><strong>2.

The state has the third-lowest poverty rate in the U.S., as well as the third-highest percentage of families that earn at least $200,000 per year. Average income per taxpayer in 2009 was $66,614, the fourth-highest rate in the U.S., and the average taxpayer gave $1,661 to charity in the same year.</p> <p><a target="_blank" href="http://247wallst.com/2011/12/09/the-most-dangerous-cities-in-the-world/">24/7 Wall St.: The Most Dangerous Cities in the World</a></p> <p><strong>3.

I also asked him (Bill Gates) to buy the copyrights to: &quot;The Adventures of Marco Polo&quot; and not be a sucker? </p> <p>I very well in Massachusetts, could be the largest donor to charity. I have near 700 artworks to my credit, that I mostly donated to super models, if they got put out to pasture. 700 original artworks, equal an equation of lithographs alone, at $1,500.00 a piece, times a series of 5000 lithographs, in the First Edition, times 700 artworks. This does not include high-resolution prints, posters, calendars, post cards and postage stamps and misc. items, like coffee mugs. </p> <p>Atlah or Harlem NY has the largest collection of mine art.

As part of the reproductive system, this gland secretes seminal fluid, energizes sperm and provides for it a favorable alkaline medium. The prostate is subject to several disease states including infection, hypertrophy and cancer, causing pain, urinary frequency and urgency, inability to urinate, painful urination and sexual dysfunction.</p> <p>[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]</p> <p>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostate cancer, and prostatitis are its most common disorders. More than 50% of men in their sixties and as many as 90% of men in their seventies and eighties are diagnosed with BPH, resulting in 375,000 hospital stays each year in the United States alone. Prostate cancer is second only to cancer of the lung as the leading cause of cancer death among men. Each year, more than 100,000 new cases of prostate cancer occur in the US, and more than 30,000 deaths are caused annually by this disease.<span class="super">1</span> The good news is that over the past 20 years, the survival rate for prostate cancer has increased from 67% to 97%.<span class="super">2</span></p> <p>Unfortunately, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer do not have a known etiology, making prevention difficult and treatment less than ideal. Standard lines of treatment for these conditions, including pharmacological preparations, surgical and non-surgical procedures, hold significant risks. Additionally, as new theories about the functioning of the prostate gland develop, scientists are questioning the effectiveness and the rationale behind the continued use of these treatment modalities. A close review of the medical literature verifies the safety and efficacy of nutritional and botanical therapeutic agents such as Serenoa repens (saw palmetto), Urtica dioica (stinging nettle root), Prunus africanum (pygeum), essential fatty acids, selenium, green tea extract, tomatoes and zinc to promote and maintain prostate health and alleviate urologic symptoms. In addition, select amino acids, in relatively physiologic doses, exhibit promising clinical results for the prostate patient. These natural ingredients effect a positive change in prostate health without the associated risk of adverse reactions. Following is a review of the most common prostate conditions and available treatment options, including a comprehensive evaluation of herbal and nutrient therapies for the prostate gland, scientific validity, positive patient outcomes, and incidences of negative side effects.</p> <p><span class="subhead1">Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH; Prostate Enlargement; Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS)</span><br />As a man ages, his prostate gland typically begins to enlarge. The medical community has no well-defined reason for this phenomenon, which is identified as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), benign prostatic hypertrophy, or lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). This condition does not generally cause symptoms until a man reaches the age of 50, with the majority of associated problems peaking by age 70. BPH causes the prostate gland to constrict the urethra, making micturition increasingly difficult. As the bladder is forced to contract against increasing resistance, the bladder muscle (the detrusor) becomes hypertrophied and irritable. As the condition progresses, the bladder becomes unable to empty completely, and finally to empty at all. Residual urine in the bladder sets the stage for serious bladder infections and kidney malfunction.</p> <p class="subhead2">Symptoms of BPH include:</p> <ul> <li>Reduced caliber and force of urine stream</li> <li> Frequent urination (particularly in the evening)</li> <li>Urinary urgency</li> <li>Leaking or dribbling</li> <li>Urinary retention (inability to pass urine)</li> </ul> <p>Occasionally, a man may not realize that he has a urinary obstruction until he finds himself unable to urinate at all. Physicians refer to this type of episode as acute urinary retention, which can be triggered by a wide variety of drugs with anticholinergic side effects, both prescription and over-the-counter, such as anti-depressants, cold and allergy medications. These medications can tighten the bladder outlet, resulting in urinary retention. Alcohol, cold temperatures or a long period of immobility can also cause urinary retention when there is a partial obstruction present. Severe BPH can have serious long-term health effects such as urinary tract infections, bladder or kidney damage, bladder stones, painful intercourse, and incontinence.</p> <p><span class="subhead1">Conventional Therapies for BPH</span><br /> Finasteride (Proscar[R]), terazosin (Hytrin[R]), doxazosin (Cardura[R]), and tamsulosin (Flomac[R]) are medications approved by the FDA for the treatment of BPH. These pharmaceuticals aim at blocking DHT production or relaxing the prostatic urethra sphincter. Specifically, finasteride (Proscar[R]) inhibits the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), while terazosin (Hytrin[R]), doxazosin (Cardura[R]), and tamsulosin (Flomac[R]) force smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate and bladder neck. Nonsurgical treatments include transurethral microwave procedures (TUMT) and transurethral needle ablation (TUNA). Surgical treatments include open, laser and transurethral (TURP) surgery. These treatments remove or destroy sections of the prostate gland. Botanical and nutritional therapies for BPH focus on decreasing the size of the prostate gland, preventing abnormal cell growth, and supplying the gland with nutrients to decrease the risk of infection, while maintaining hormonal balance and preserving the complete gland.</p> <p><span class="subhead1">A Closer Look at Finasteride (Proscar)</span><br /> Finasteride (Proscar[R]), a popular prescription for BPH, functions by interfering with the action of 5 alpha-reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone into DHT in the prostate gland. DHT is an androgen that stimulates the synthesis of specific proteins and causes prostate cells to proliferate. The theory behind finasteride is that the body is producing too much testosterone and ultimately DHT, which is causing abnormal cell proliferation. By blocking the action of 5 alpha-reductase, the prostate gland should shrink.</p> <p>Merck sponsored a double-blind placebo controlled study using finasteride (Proscar[R]) that demonstrated significant reductions in DHT,<span class="super">3</span> improvements in urinary function,<span class="super">4</span> and decreases in prostate volume<span class="super">5</span> in men with BPH. A bias may be present considering the sponsor of this research although there are more pressing issues regarding the use of finasteride. First, finasteride (Proscar[R]) only decreases the size of the prostate gland by 18% even though it reduces DHT levels by a surprising 80%. Further, only 37% of men using the drug for an entire year experience any symptom improvement. Sexual side effects of finasteride include decreased libido, impotence, and ejaculatory disorders.<span class="super">6</span> Finasteride (Proscar[R]) also increases a man's risk of developing prostate cancer.<span class="super">7</span> While this drug is in fact lowering DHT levels, it is clearly not promoting the health of the prostate gland. Moreover, the theory that DHT is the primary cause of abnormal cell growth is scientifically invalid, since a dramatic decrease in DHT levels plays a minimal role in preventing abnormal cell growth, and may even promote it. This theory represents a narrow and disconnected view of prostate function. A man's serum testosterone level falls as he ages. If testosterone causes BPH, then why would a man's risk of developing BPH increase as his levels of testosterone decrease? There is clearly more to this picture than that which medical scientists currently accept as fact.</p> <p>The answer to this dilemma might be the growing imbalance between estrogen and testosterone levels in aging men. While estrogen levels remain relatively unchanged, testosterone or androgen levels fall dramatically as a man ages. However, in the stroma of the prostate (the area of tissue where BPH is thought to develop), DHT levels remain constant, while estrogen levels dramatically increase. The stroma produces additional estrogen (specifically estradiol) from testosterone in a process known as aromatization. Human sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) also affects the estrogen/testosterone ratio, since levels of SHBG increase with age. Normally, androgens like testosterone have an affinity for SHBG and cause cell proliferation. Medical researchers are discovering, however, that estrogen binds to SHBG as well, causing abnormal cell proliferation in the prostate. This information becomes particularly pertinent when viewed in light of the mechanisms of action of saw palmetto, nettle root and pygeum (discussed in detail in subsequent sections of this paper), and their clinical efficacy in the prevention and treatment of BPH and cancer.<span class="super">8</span></p> <p><span class="subhead1">A Closer Look at Prostate Surgery</span><br /> Most physicians recommend removal of the enlarged part of the prostate as the best long-term solution for patients with BPH.<span class="super">9</span> After any surgery for BPH, a Foley catheter is temporarily inserted through the penis to drain urine from the bladder into a collection bag while the surgical site is healing. This catheter frequently causes infection and recurring painful bladder spasms. Sexual function is affected in up to 30% of surgical cases, including retrograde ejaculation (which causes sterility). Furthermore, surgery for BPH does not prevent future prostate problems since a portion of the gland remains. Finally, scar tissue from the surgery typically forms in the urethra and causes narrowing (which is what the surgery is supposed to relieve). Patients with severe BPH who have already failed botanical and nutrient combinations and drug therapies may require surgical intervention to restore urinary flow. In order to prevent surgical intervention, it is essential to utilize noninvasive therapies at the onset of BPH symptoms or before. Medical professionals use pharmaceutical agents and surgical treatments as a standard approach to managing patients with moderate BPH. The risks of such therapies can outweigh their benefits. However, other scientifically valid therapies, including key nutrient and herbal combinations, are at least as effective clinically, without the associated risks.</p> <p><span class="subhead1">Prostate Cancer</span><br /> Cancer of the prostate gland is the most commonly diagnosed non-dermatological cancer among men. It is a leading cause of cancer death among American men, second only to lung cancer. In the United States, more than 30,000 men die each year from prostate cancer. One in five men will develop prostate cancer in his lifetime, and three percent of those will die from it.</p> <p>The condition occurs when normal prostate cells turn cancerous (malignant) and divide at an unreasonable rate. It most often develops in the region of the prostate closest to the rectum. African-American men, men aged 65 and older, and men who have a first-degree relative with prostate cancer are at an increased risk. Black Americans have the highest incidence in the world. Interestingly, there is a direct correlation between intake of animal fat and the risk of getting prostate cancer. The National Cancer Institute established that total consumption of animal fat directly relates to the risk of advanced prostate cancer. Red meat has the strongest positive association with advanced prostate cancer.<span class="super">10</span> It is critical to note that the association is only with saturated animal fat. In fact, essential fatty acids (EFAs), given in the correct ratios, may prove to be a key in preventing prostate cancer, and even promoting the health of the gland.</p> <p><span class="subhead1">Symptoms</span><br /> There are essentially no warning signs for early prostate cancer. As the cancer advances, some men may experience symptoms similar to those associated with BPH (urinary frequency, urgency, pain with urination, etc.) or a urinary tract infection.</p> <p><span class="subhead1">Early Detection and Treatment</span><br /> There is no scientific evidence that provides a definite link between early detection and even treatment of prostate cancer and the incidence of deaths caused by this disease.<span class="super">11</span> Further, if a health professional diagnoses a man with early stage prostate cancer, it is highly likely that he will then be required to undergo invasive evaluation. If this evaluation results in cancer detection, then standard treatments are generally employed. Standard treatments such as surgery, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy and occasionally chemotherapy have serious side effects including incontinence (lack of bladder control), impotence (inability to have an erection), and even death.<span class="super">11</span> One treatment option for men with early-stage prostate cancer is &quot;watchful waiting.&quot; Since many prostate cancers are small and grow slowly, physicians may opt to shun treatment altogether (watchful waiting), which is an accepted approach to managing the condition. A benefit of this method is that it avoids any potential side effects that may occur with other forms of treatment. Men choosing this method of treatment (or lack thereof) often turn to nutrient and botanical therapies as a means of safely treating their cancer. Interestingly, a study completed at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital<span class="super">12</span> found that one third of all prostate cancer patients supplement medical treatment with complementary therapies.</p> <p><span class="subhead1">Prostatitis</span><br /> Acute bacterial prostatitis is an acute infection of the prostate gland. Bacteria usually migrate to the prostate from the urinary system. As the infection advances, the gland begins to swell, causing sudden symptoms of painful, urgent and frequent urination. Other symptoms include fever and chills, and pain over the bladder, lower back and between the testicles and rectum (the perineal area). The standard medical treatment for acute prostatitis is usually intravenous antibiotics until the fever breaks, followed by 4-6 weeks (or longer) of oral antibiotic therapy. It is critical that one seeks medical attention promptly if he experiences fever-associated pain in the areas described above.</p> <p>Chronic bacterial prostatitis is usually symptomatic, causing vague, persistent, low back and perineal pain, urinary urgency and frequency, and painful urination. Standard medical treatment is oral antibiotic therapy for 2 to 3 months. Patients can also experience prostatitis that is not the result of a bacterial invasion. This condition is referred to as chronic non-bacterial or non-infectious prostatitis. Chronic non-bacterial prostatitis is more common than bacterial prostatitis, and has the same symptom picture. Having no known cause, healthcare professionals find it difficult to treat. It does not respond to antimicrobial agents. Serenoa repens (saw palmetto), Urtica dioica (stinging nettle root), Prunus africanum (pygeum), zinc, selenium, green tea extract, tomatoes, amino acid therapy, and essential fatty acid therapy are effective and safe treatment options for nonbacterial, non-infectious prostatitis.</p> <p class="subhead1">Botanical and Nutritional Therapeutic Options for Prostate Conditions</p> <p><span class="subhead2">Serenoa repens (Saw Palmetto)</span><br /> Description and Medical History: Saw palmetto is native to North America. It is a member of the fan palm family and has characteristic sharp edges that can literally &quot;saw&quot; through clothing, hence its common name, saw-palm-etto. The plant produces a one-seeded dark brown-to-black berry that is harvested and used in the preparation of phytomedicines. Researchers now focus on the lipophilic medicinal extracts of these berries, although one should not ignore its historic use as a whole berry preparation. Traditionally used for the treatment of prostate conditions, saw palmetto was appropriately referred to as the &quot;old man's friend.&quot; Touted for its effectiveness in reducing prostate inflammation, alleviating chronic urinary tract infections, and increasing sperm count, this herb has demonstrated the added benefit of increasing sex drive in men.<span class="super">13, 14</span></p> <span class="subhead2">Known Medicinal Constituents</span> <ul> <li>Lipoid constituents: Phytosterols, particularly beta-sitosterol, tri, di, and monoglycerides, and free fatty acids</li> <li>Flavonoids and polysaccharides</li> </ul> Indications for Use (specific to prostate health) <ul> <li>Mild to moderate benign prostatic hyperplasia<span class="super">14-16</span></li> <li>Non-infectious (non-bacterial) prostatitis<span class="super">17</span></li> <li>Prostate cancer<span class="super">18, 19</span><br /> </li> </ul> <span class="subhead2">Possible Mechanisms of Action</span> <ul> <li>Has alpha-adrenoreceptor and calcium blocking activities (antagonists) that function to relieve urinary urgency by reducing the smooth muscle contractions of the bladder sphincter<span class="super">20</span></li> <li>Inhibits the binding of DHT to androgen receptor sites in the cytosolic component of prostate cells<span class="super">21, 22</span></li> <li>Inhibits prolactin-induced prostate growth<span class="super">23</span></li> <li>Inihibits the binding of growth stimulating estrogen to receptor sites on the prostate cells and reduces the number of estrogen and androgen receptors in the nuclear fraction of the prostate cell<span class="super">24</span></li> <li>Exhibits mild 5-alpha reductase inhibition activity in the prostate gland<span class="super">25, 26</span></li> <li>Inhibits the arachadonic acid cascade via the inhibition of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase in the prostate<span class="super">27</span> </li> </ul> <p><span class="subhead1">Double-Blind Clinical Trials with Saw Palmetto in BPH</span><br /> Wilt et al.<span class="super">28</span> conducted a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of the existing evidence regarding the therapeutic efficacy and safety of saw palmetto plant extracts in men with mild to moderate benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The researchers evaluated 18 randomized controlled trials that included 2,939 men with a mean age of 65 years. Sixteen of these studies (89%) were double-blinded and placebo controlled, and the mean duration of the studies was 63 days. The researchers measured the efficacy of saw palmetto extracts in affecting urologic symptoms, urine flow, residual urine volume, prostate size and nocturia. The study participants (that were treated with saw palmetto) and their physicians reported significant improvements in BPH symptoms compared to the placebo group. The men had decreased urinary tract symptom scores overall, fewer episodes of nocturia (-0.76 times per night), and an increase of peak urine flow rates (1.93 mL/s [95% CI, 0.72-3.14]). All trials in this meta-analysis produced similar improvement in urinary tract symptoms and urinary flow rates when measured against finasteride, and were associated with significantly fewer adverse side effects.</p> <p>Table 1.1 highlights seven key placebo-controlled clinical trials with a liposterolic extract of saw palmetto, all of which were a part of the recent systematic review by Wilt et al.<span class="super">28</span> In six out of seven of the studies, urinary frequency was dramatically decreased in the saw palmetto treatment group as compared to the placebo group. The saw palmetto group experienced a significant improvement in peak flow rates (26-50%) compared to the placebo group (2-35%). While symptom score evaluations are a valuable means of analyzing outcomes, the researchers did not routinely complete these evaluations since many of the studies were done before this methodology was widely accepted.<span class="super">29</span></p> <p><span class="subhead1">Finasteride vs. Saw Palmetto Extract</span><br /> Carraro et al.<span class="super">30</span> completed the largest international comparative trial for the treatment of BPH. This double-blind study compared the therapeutic effects of finasteride versus saw palmetto extract in 1,098 patients with moderate BPH. The most critical observation of this comparative trial was that saw palmetto extract does not have a significant effect on serum PSA levels or prostate volume. With this knowledge, physicians do not need to be concerned that saw palmetto will affect PSA levels and mask prostate cancer. This clinical evidence also makes it clear that the primary action of saw palmetto is not its ability to inhibit 5-alpha reductase, since PSA levels remained relatively constant.

Collectively, these trials demonstrated the benefits of using nettle root for the treatment of BPH. In a 1996 placebo controlled trial, Engelmann et al.<span class="super">40</span> successfully demonstrated that nettle root extract was superior to placebo in terms of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). The study included 41 subjects with mild BPH, observed for a period of 3 months. In an older placebo controlled trial (1987),<span class="super">41</span> 79 patients with BPH were given either nettle root extract or placebo for as long as two months. The dosage was 600 mg per day for the duration of the study. Nettle root proved to be better than the placebo in all parameters that were measured including urinary flow, residual urine and urinary volume. In 1985, Vontobel et al.<span class="super">42</span> conducted a placebo controlled clinical trial that demonstrated a significant improvement in urinary flow and micturition volume, and an impressive decrease in SHBG (p&lt;0.0005). The study included 50 patients that were prescribed 600 mg of nettle root extract daily for approximately two months.</p> <p><span class="subhead1">Placebo Controlled Clinical Trials of Stinging Nettle Root/Saw Palmetto Combination Therapies</span><br />Metzker et al.<span class="super">43</span> completed a double blind placebo controlled clinical trial involving 40 BPH patients that took either a placebo treatment or a mixture of nettle root and Saw palmetto extracts for 6 months. The experimental group showed a dramatic improvement in IPSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) as compared to the placebo group. Additionally, urinary flow rates improved significantly in the experimental group compared to the placebo group. Details of this study are highlighted in Table 2.1. The 6-month double blind treatment was followed by an open-label extension. Interestingly, the placebo group demonstrated a marked improvement in urinary flow rates from 15.50 to 17.5 ml/sec. However, the group receiving the saw palmetto/ nettle extract demonstrated a further statistically significant increase in urinary flow rate with continued therapy for one year.</p> <p>Sokeland et al.<span class="super">44</span> completed another comparison trial with finasteride and a saw palmetto/nettle root extract. This randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial involved 543 patients suffering from BPH stages I and II. Both therapies proved to be similar in effectiveness in all areas including: IPSS scores, urination times, and urinary flow rate. The major difference was in tolerability. Patients tolerated herbal therapy better than finasteride. The finasteride group reported more adverse events including diminished ejaculation volume, erectile dysfunction and headaches.

The researchers evenly distributed 85 patients with mild to moderate BPH among three centers. IPSS scores decreased by 40% and quality of life scores by 32%. There was also a statistically significant reduction in nocturnal frequency (32%) although urinary flow parameters remained unchanged. The researchers reported a particularly satisfactory safety profile. An interesting aspect of this study was the researchers' decision to follow the patients after the initial treatment for an additional month with no treatment. The results of the treatment remained positive even after it was stopped, indicating a persistent therapeutic activity.

In addition to being antioxidants and free-radical scavengers, these compounds inhibit the expression of oncogene and the action of three enzymes believed to play a role in oncogenesis. They have demonstrated anti-cancer activity in laboratory mice carrying human prostate and breast cancers and mouse lung and skin cancers.</p> <p>Two catechins found in green tea, epicatechin gallate (ECG), and epigallocatechin-3 gallate (EGCG) are inhibitors of 5-alpha reductase which may be effective in the treatment of 5 alpha dihydrotestosterone-dependent abnormalities, such as benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer. It may be possible that these catechins are regulating androgen action in the prostate gland. As described earlier in this article, 5 alpha-reductase is the enzyme that converts testosterone into DHT in the prostate gland. DHT is an androgen that stimulates the synthesis of specific proteins and causes prostate cells to proliferate. The theory behind 5-alpha reductase blocking agents is that the body is producing too much testosterone and ultimately DHT, which is causing abnormal cell proliferation. By blocking the action of 5 alpha-reductase, the prostate gland should shrink.<span class="super">60</span></p> <p><span class="subhead1">Alanine, Glutamine, and Glycine</span><br /> In 1958, Feinblatt and Gant<span class="super">61</span> completed a controlled crossover study using a combination of alanine, glutamine and glycine to treat BPH symptoms. The study included 40 men with confirmed BPH. After 3 months on the amino acid combination, the authors reported that delayed micturition was either relieved or reduced by 70%, nighttime urinary frequency was reduced by 95%, urinary urgency decreased by 81% and urinary frequency decreased by 73%. These preliminary results inspired the work of Damrau in 1962. He conducted a controlled study that included 45 cases of uncomplicated BPH in an experimental group and 40 cases of uncomplicated BPH in a control group. The age, weight and height of all subjects were closely matched. The experimental group received the combination amino acid therapy daily for three months. Table 4.1 reveals the results of this study.</p> <p>Damrau<span class="super">62</span> confirmed the results of the original study conducted by Feinblatt and Gant<span class="super">61</span> on the safety and efficacy of using a combination of alanine, glutamine, and glycine in the treatment of BPH. Damrau reported that he observed no side effects in the experimental group.</p> <p>In 1978 Cuervo et al.<span class="super">63</span> studied the effects of the amino acid combination (alanine, glutamine, glycine) together with the herb, Prunus arborea. They determined that the inclusion of the amino acids with the herb led to a considerable reduction in the duration of treatment for BPH patients resulting in significant financial savings. This study included 100 patients with prostatic adenoma, prostatitis, and BPH.</p> <p>In Japan, this amino acid combination is available as Paraprost for the treatment of BPH. Maekawa<span class="super">64</span> compared the effects of Paraprost with another drug, Cernilton, on BPH. This multicenter double blind study included 192 patients with BPH. The researchers determined that Paraprost (the amino acid combination) was more than moderately effective in 46.3% of the patients studied. Yamaguchi et al. (1990) also compared the effects of Paraprost with another drug (a selective alpha 1-adrenoreceptor blocker) in a double-blind multi-institutional study. They observed 77 patients with BPH and determined that Paraprost significantly improved obstructive and irritative symptoms, and reduced the incidence of residual urine.</p> <p>The combination of these three amino acids--alanine, glutamine and glycine--offers favorable clinical results for the patient with BPH. The therapy appears to enhance the positive effects of herbal prostate medicines.</p> <p><span class="subhead1">Zinc</span><br /> The prostate gland has a unique characteristic of storing remarkably high levels of zinc. In fact, healthy prostate tissue contains a higher concentration of zinc than any other tissue in the human body. It is no coincidence that the level of zinc in the prostate gland declines dramatically in patients with BPH, and even more so in patients with prostate cancer. Zaicheick et al.<span class="super">65</span> studied 109 patients with BPH (50 cases) and prostate cancer (109 cases). The researchers used transrectal punch biopsy of prostate and radionuclide-induced energy dispersive X-ray fluorescent analysis to determine zinc concentrations in prostate tissue. They showed that the zinc content in cancerous prostate tissue was dramatically less than the concentration found in healthy prostate tissue. Specifically, zinc content of the normal prostate was 1018 micrograms/g dry tissue (M+/-124) compared to 146 M+/-10 in the cancerous prostate tissue. Costello et al.<span class="super">66</span> found an interesting correlation between citrate metabolism in the prostate, zinc accumulation, and prostate cancer. They determined that, in addition to zinc, the prostate accumulates and secretes exceptional levels of citrate from prostate epithelial cells. These cells will not secrete normal amounts of citrate if the zinc level in prostatic mitochondria drops. Specifically, the accumulation of zinc inhibits an enzyme that causes citrate oxidation. Thus, in patients with prostate cancer, as the level of zinc in the prostate drops, the threat of citrate oxidation increases. Perhaps the most interesting finding was that prolactin and testosterone regulate the concentration of zinc in the epithelial cells that produce citrate. Numerous medical researchers have made the correlation between zinc levels and BPH and cancer.<span class="super">65,67-71</span> Despite this correlation, there has been little support for further investigation of the nutritional etiology of BPH and prostate cancer. It is also important to note that preliminary research suggests that over supplementation with zinc (over 100 mg per day) for prolonged periods may increase risk of prostate carcinogenesis. This is based on an epidemiological study<span class="super">72</span> where confounding variables exist, including concurrent high dose supplement intake of other ingredients such as calcium. Nevertheless, it does elucidate the point that more is not necessarily better with dietary supplement intake.</p> <p><span class="subhead1">Tomatoes</span><br /> Compared to other known carotenoids, lycopene is considered by experts to be one of the most potent antioxidants, with its unsurpassed singletoxygen quenching capacity. An impressive number of clinical trials and epidemiological studies demonstrate the statistically significant association between consumption of lycopene in foods, such as tomatoes and prostate health. However, most of the investigations are plagued by the uncertainties common to dietary therapeutics--the variability in food content of the agent under investigation, its isoforms, the multiple unknown interactions between the suspect chemical and the many other ingredients in the host food, influences of other dietary variables, and even the pharmacokinetics of the agent in the human body. Nevertheless, accumulated evidence to date supports a benefit from lycopene in one form or another, and more so when obtained from whole foods, in reducing the risk of prostate cancer.<span class="super">73</span></p> <p><span class="subhead1">Selenium</span><br /> Selenium may have potent anti-cancer properties. Results from laboratory experiments suggest that selenium-enriched broccoli activates certain anti-cancer transcription pathways in mouse livers.<span class="super">74</span> Dog data suggest that dietary selenium supplementation decreases DNA damage and increases epithelial cell apoptosis within the aging canine prostate.<span class="super">75</span></p> <p>One of several prospective human selenium studies to show a positive effect on cancer was published in 1996 in JAMA.<span class="super">76</span> The researchers had originally chosen only skin cancer but included prostate, lung and colorectal seven years into the 13-year study because of positive results. The study included almost 1000 men from regions of the US with mean plasma selenium concentrations in the lower range of US levels. The double-blinded, randomized study gave 200 micrograms of selenium as brewer's yeast, or placebo, daily for 4.5 years and followed the subjects for an additional 6.4 years. Total cancer incidence (77 cases versus 119), prostate cancers (13 versus 35), colorectal cancers (8 versus 19), and lung cancers (17 versus 31) were all significantly lower in the selenium group than in the placebo group. There was no detectable increase in adverse effects from the supplementation. Because the study was small and not originally planned for the significant endpoints and the population was in the lowest range of selenium levels, it is considered preliminary and in need of verification. Nevertheless, it strongly suggests a beneficial and safe role for this supplement.</p> <p>A population study carried out on 212 cases and 233 controls found a modest negative correlation between serum selenium levels and the incidence of prostate cancer.<span class="super">77</span> The inverse association with selenium was strongest among men with low serum concentrations of [alpha]-tocopherol, another antioxidant.</p> <p><span class="subhead1">Essential Fatty Acids</span><br /> The body synthesizes some fat on its own, but there are also fats that the body is incapable of manufacturing known as &quot;essential fatty acids&quot; or EFAs. They are the omega 3 (alpha-linolenic) and omega 6 (linoleic) fatty acids. Essential fatty acids are required constituents of every membrane in the body. Classic signs of deficiency include depression, mood disorders, memory loss, hyperactivity, anxiety, dry flaking skin, inflammation, arthritic pain, bursitis, decreased bone density, easy bruising, muscle spasms, food allergies, fatigue, increased body fat, sub-clinical and clinical hypoglycemia, hormonal imbalance and dry hair. EFAs are required to maintain the health of every living cell in the body. They maintain the fluidity of cellular membranes, aid in producing and balancing hormones, and play an essential role in managing inflammation. From essential fatty acids the body produces many compounds including a group of components known as prostaglandins. Interestingly, the word prostaglandin comes from the fact that these products of fatty acid metabolism were originally found in the prostate gland (prosta--gland--in). Prostaglandins regulate every organ system in the body. One essential rate-limiting enzyme in the transformation of EFAs into the important prostaglandins is [delta]-6-desaturase. Interestingly, zinc deficiency blocks this enzyme. Other factors that block this enzyme include trans fatty acids, vitamin B3 and B6 deficiencies, toxic chemicals, alcohol, and some viruses.</p> <p>A study conducted by medical researchers in Korea established a connection between BPH, prostate cancer, and essential fatty acids. Yang et al.<span class="super">78</span> examined the role of dietary fatty acids in benign and malignant prostate disease by comparing serum fatty acid levels in normal controls, patients with prostate cancer, and patients with BPH. They also looked at the relative difference in omega 3/omega 6 fatty acid ratios between the three groups. The omega 3/omega 6 fatty acid ratios decreased progressively from control (largest fraction) to BPH to prostate cancer (lowest fraction) indicating that BPH patients have less omega 3 fatty acids in their serum, and prostate cancer patients have significantly less omega 3 fatty acids in their serum. This is a landmark study, as it makes a direct correlation between omega 3 fatty acid deficiencies and prostate disease (BPH and cancer).</p> <p>Researchers are still not clear on what the entire purpose of the prostate gland is and the extent of its functions. What the medical community does know is that it is a critical gland of the male reproductive system and that when this gland is diseased in any way, it can cause a tremendous amount of pain and suffering for the male patient. After reviewing the various conditions associated with prostate disease, including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatitis, and even cancer, and examining the standard lines of treatment for these conditions, herbal and nutrient medicines appear to be an important primary or complementary therapy for the male patient experiencing sub-optimal prostate health.</p> <p><span class="subhead2">Table 1.1</span> Double Blind Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials of Saw palmetto Extract in BPH Patients<br /> </p> <table width="100%" border="2" id="article_table1"> <tbody> <tr> <th># of Patients</th> <th>Daily Dosage Saw palmetto</th> <th>Researchers (mg/b.i.d.) group (SP) vs. Regime Placebo</th> <th>% Reduction in Urinary % Increase in</th> <th>Researchers Frequency Peak Urinary (at night) Flow Rate</th> <th>Tolerability of Therapy</th> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td>Tasca et al.

The Republican victory in that election resulted in seven Southern states declaring their <a href="/wiki/Secession_in_the_United_States" title="Secession in the United States">secession</a> from the Union even before Lincoln took office on March 4, 1861. Both the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations rejected secession, regarding it as <a href="/wiki/Rebellion" title="Rebellion">rebellion</a>.</p> <p>Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Sumter" title="Battle of Fort Sumter">Confederate forces attacked a U.S. military installation</a> at <a href="/wiki/Fort_Sumter" title="Fort Sumter">Fort Sumter</a> in <a href="/wiki/South_Carolina" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a>.

In September 1862, Lincoln's <a href="/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation" title="Emancipation Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a> made ending slavery in the South a war goal, and dissuaded the British from intervening. Confederate commander <a href="/wiki/Robert_E._Lee" title="Robert E. Lee">Robert E.

This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the &quot;rock upon which the old Union would split.&quot; He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted. The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old constitution, were that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with, but the general opinion of the men of that day was that, somehow or other in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away. This idea, though not incorporated in the constitution, was the prevailing idea at that time. The constitution, it is true, secured every essential guarantee to the institution while it should last, and hence no argument can be justly urged against the constitutional guarantees thus secured, because of the common sentiment of the day. Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the government built upon it fell when the &quot;storm came and the wind blew.&quot; Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner- stone rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery -- subordination to the superior race -- is his natural and normal condition.

Between these, according to their theory, sprung the 'irrepressible conflict,' in principle, which ended in the terrible conflict in arms. Those who assume this postulate, and so theorize upon it, are but superficial observers. That the war had its origin in opposing principles, which in their action upon the conduct of men, produced the ultimate conflict of arms, may be assumed as an unquestionable fact. But the opposing principles which produced these results in physical action were of a very different character from those assumed in the postulate. They lay in the organic Structure of the Government of the States ... between the supporters of a strictly Federative Government, on the one side, and a thoroughly National one, on the other.&quot;</li> <li id="cite_note-15"><b><a href="#cite_ref-15" title="">^</a></b> James McPherson, This Mighty Scourge page 4. McPherson writes, &quot;After the war, however, Davis and Stephens changed their tune. By the time they wrote their histories of the Confederacy, slavery was gone with the wind -- a dead and discredited institution. To concede that the Confederacy had broken up the United States and launched a war that killed 620,000 Americans in a vain attempt to keep four million people in bondage would not confer honor on their lost cause.</li> <li id="cite_note-16"><b><a href="#cite_ref-16" title="">^</a></b> James McPherson, This Mighty Scourge, pages 3-9. Speaking of alternative explanations for secession, McPherson writes (p. 7), &quot;While one or more of these interpretations remain popular among the Sons of Confederate Veterans and other Southern heritage groups, few professional historians now subscribe to them. Of all these interpretations, the state's-rights argument is perhaps the weakest. It fails to ask the question, state's rights for what purpose? State's rights, or sovereignty, was always more a means than an end, an instrument to achieve a certain goal more than a principle.</li> <li id="cite_note-Tariff-17"><b><a href="#cite_ref-Tariff_17-0" title="">^</a></b> Allan Nevins, Ordeal of the Union: A House Dividing - 1852-1857, pages 267���269</li> <li id="cite_note-18"><b><a href="#cite_ref-18" title="">^</a></b> Freehling, <i>Prelude to Civil War,</i> page 297; Willentz page 388 - On March 13, 1833, Rhett said, &quot;A people, owning slaves, are mad, or worse than mad, who do not hold their destinies in their own hands...

The truth can no longer be disguised, that the peculiar domestick [sic] institution of the Southern States and the consequent direction which that and her soil have given to her industry, has placed them in regard to taxation and appropriations in opposite relation to the majority of the Union, against the danger of which, if there be no protective power in the reserved rights of the states they must in the end be forced to rebel, or, submit to have their paramount interests sacrificed, their domestic institutions subordinated by Colonization and other schemes, and themselves and children reduced to wretchedness.&quot; - Ellis, Richard E.

What had begun as a reaction to a depression in the cotton states, a slump that had been particularly severe in South Carolina, had rapidly resolved itself into an all-encompassing fear on the part of a majority of the planter elite class that the growing industrialization of the North, expressing itself politically through the majority will, would eventually demand emancipation, heedless of the social consequences.&quot;</li> <li id="cite_note-21"><b><a href="#cite_ref-21" title="">^</a></b> William E.

At roughly 13� North and 59� West, the country lies in the southern <a href="/entry/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> region, where it is part of the Lesser Antilles island-chain. Barbados is relatively close to the <a href="/entry/South_America" title="South America">South American</a> continent, around 434 kilometers (270 miles) northeast of <a href="/entry/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>. Its closest island neighbors are <a href="/entry/Saint_Lucia" title="Saint Lucia">Saint Lucia</a> and <a href="/entry/Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines" title="Saint Vincent and the Grenadines">Saint Vincent and the Grenadines</a> to the west, <a href="/entry/Grenada" title="Grenada">Grenada</a> to the south-west, and <a href="/entry/Trinidad_and_Tobago" title="Trinidad and Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a> to the south, with which Barbados now shares a fixed official maritime boundary.</p> <p>Barbados' total land area is about 430 square kilometers, (166 square miles), and is primarily low-lying, with some higher regions in the island's interior. The organic composition of Barbados is thought to be of non-volcanic origin and is predominantly composed of <a href="/entry/Limestone" title="Limestone">limestone</a>-<a href="/entry/Coral" title="Coral">coral</a>. The island's climate is <a href="/entry/Tropical" class="mw-redirect" title="Tropical">tropical</a> with constant trade winds off the Atlantic Ocean serving to keep temperatures mild. Some more undeveloped areas of the country contain woodland and scrubland. Other parts of the interior which contribute to the agriculture industry are dotted with large sugarcane estates and wide, gently sloping pastures, with many good views down to the sea coast.</p> <p>Barbados has one of the highest standards of living and literacy rates in the world. Despite its small size, Barbados constantly ranks in the top 35 countries in the Human Development Index (HDI) rankings. It is currently ranked third in the Americas. The island is also a major tourist destination.</p> <table id="toc" class="toc" summary="Contents"> <tbody> <tr> <td> <div id="toctitle"> <h2>Contents</h2> </div> <ul> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Geography"><span class="tocnumber">1</span> <span class="toctext">Geography</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#History"><span class="tocnumber">2</span> <span class="toctext">History</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Politics"><span class="tocnumber">3</span> <span class="toctext">Politics</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Economy"><span class="tocnumber">4</span> <span class="toctext">Economy</span></a> <ul> <li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#Natural_resources"><span class="tocnumber">4.1</span> <span class="toctext">Natural resources</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#Weather_impacts"><span class="tocnumber">4.2</span> <span class="toctext">Weather impacts</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#Consumer_spending"><span class="tocnumber">4.3</span> <span class="toctext">Consumer spending</span></a></li> </ul></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Demographics"><span class="tocnumber">5</span> <span class="toctext">Demographics</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Culture"><span class="tocnumber">6</span> <span class="toctext">Culture</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Sports_in_Barbados"><span class="tocnumber">7</span> <span class="toctext">Sports in Barbados</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Tourism"><span class="tocnumber">8</span> <span class="toctext">Tourism</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Notes"><span class="tocnumber">9</span> <span class="toctext">Notes</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#References"><span class="tocnumber">10</span> <span class="toctext">References</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#External_links"><span class="tocnumber">11</span> <span class="toctext">External links</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Credits"><span class="tocnumber">12</span> <span class="toctext">Credits</span></a></li> </ul></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[ if (window.showTocToggle) { var tocShowText = "show"; var tocHideText = "hide"; showTocToggle(); } //]]></script> <p><a name="Geography" id="Geography"></a></p> <h2><span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2> <p>The origin of the name Barbados is unclear. Portugal was the first European country to &quot;discover&quot; and name the island. As early as 1511, the island is referred to as Isla de los Barbados (island of the bearded ones) in an official Portuguese document. It is a matter of conjecture whether the word &quot;bearded&quot; refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree <i>(Ficus citrifolia),</i> indigenous to the island, to bearded Amerindians occupying the island, or to the foam spraying over the outlying reefs giving the impression of a beard.</p> <p>Barbados is grouped as an island of the Lesser Antilles, although it is not strictly a part of the Lesser Antilles due to its different geological formation. It is situated 480 kilometers north of <a href="/entry/Guyana" title="Guyana">Guyana</a>, 160 kilometers east of <a href="/entry/Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines" title="Saint Vincent and the Grenadines">St. Vincent</a>. This isolated pear-shaped island extends for 34 kilometers along a north-south axis and has a maximum breadth of 23 kilometers, giving it a total land area of 430 square kilometers.</p> <p>Barbados is fringed with <a href="/entry/Coral" title="Coral">coral</a> reefs. The island itself is characterized by lowlands or gently sloping, terraced plains, separated by rolling hills that generally parallel the coasts. Elevations in the interior range from 180 to 240 meters above sea level. Mount Hillaby is the highest point at 340 meters above sea level. Farther south, at Christ Church Ridge, elevations range from sixty to ninety meters.</p> <div class="floatright"> <span><a href="/entry/Image:Barbados.gif" class="image" title="Map of Barbados"><img alt="Map of Barbados" src="http://static.newworldencyclopedia.org/thumb/e/e9/Barbados.gif/250px-Barbados.gif" width="250" height="306" border="0" /></a></span> </div> <p>Eighty-five percent of the island's surface consists of coralline <a href="/entry/Limestone" title="Limestone">limestone</a> twenty-four to thirty meters thick; Scotland District contains outcroppings of oceanic formations at the surface, however. Sugarcane is planted on almost 80 percent of the island's limestone surface. The soils vary in fertility; erosion is a problem, with crop loss resulting from landslides, washouts, and falling rocks. Most of the small streams are in Scotland District. The rest of the island has few surface streams; nevertheless, rainwater saturates the soil to produce underground channels such as the famous Coles Cave.</p> <p>Barbados lies within the tropics. Its generally pleasant maritime climate is influenced by northeast trade winds, which moderate the tropical temperature. Cool, northeasterly trade winds are prevalent during the December to June dry season. The overall annual temperature ranges from 24�C to 28�C; slightly lower temperatures prevail at higher elevations. Humidity levels are between 71 percent and 76 percent year round. Rainfall occurs primarily between July and December and varies considerably with elevation. Rainfall may average 187.5 centimeters per year in the higher central area as compared with 127.5 centimeters in the coastal zone.</p> <p>Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's tropical storms and hurricanes during the rainy season as its far eastern location in the <a href="/entry/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> puts it just outside the principal hurricane belt. The island does get brushed or hit about every three years and the average time between direct hurricane hits is about 26 years.</p> <p><a name="History" id="History"></a></p> <h2><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2> <p>The earliest inhabitants of Barbados were <a href="/entry/Native_American" class="mw-redirect" title="Native American">Native American</a> nomads. Three waves of migrants moved north toward North America. The first wave was of the Saladoid-Barrancoid group, who were farmers and fishermen and arrived by <a href="/entry/Canoe" title="Canoe">canoe</a> from <a href="/entry/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> (<a href="/entry/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>'s <a href="/entry/Orinoco_River" title="Orinoco River">Orinoco Valley</a>) around 350 <small>C.E.</small> The <a href="/entry/Arawak" class="mw-redirect" title="Arawak">Arawak</a> people were the second wave of migrants, arriving from South America around 800 <small>C.E.</small> Arawak settlements on the island include Stroud Point, Chandler Bay, Saint Luke's Gully and Mapp's Cave. According to accounts by descendants of the aboriginal Arawak tribes on other local islands, the original name for Barbados was <b>Ichirouganaim.</b> In the thirteenth century, the Caribs arrived from South America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid. For the next few centuries, the Caribslike the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoidlived in isolation on the island.</p> <p>Portuguese Conquistadors seized many Caribs on Barbados and used them as slave labor on plantations. Other Caribs fled the island.</p> <p>British sailors who landed on Barbados in 1625, at the site of present-day Holetown on the Caribbean coast found the island uninhabited. From the arrival of the first British settlers in 1627-28 until independence in 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted British control. Nevertheless, Barbados always enjoyed a large measure of local autonomy. Its House of Assembly began meeting in 1639. Among the initial important British figures was Sir William Courten.</p> <p>Starting in the 1620s, an increasing number of black slaves were brought to the island. Five thousand locals died of fever in 1647, and hundreds of slaves were executed by Royalist planters during the <a href="/entry/English_Civil_War" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a> in the 1640s, because they feared that the ideas of the Levellers might spread to the slave population if Parliament took control of Barbados.</p> <div class="thumb tright"> <div class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"> <a href="/entry/Image:The_Barbadoes_Mulatto_Girl.jpg" class="image" title="The Barbadoes Mulatto Girl, after Agostino Brunias, 1779."><img alt="The Barbadoes Mulatto Girl, after Agostino Brunias, 1779." src="http://static.newworldencyclopedia.org/thumb/2/2e/The_Barbadoes_Mulatto_Girl.jpg/180px-The_Barbadoes_Mulatto_Girl.jpg" width="180" height="236" border="0" class="thumbimage" /></a> <div class="thumbcaption"> <div class="magnify"> <a href="/entry/Image:The_Barbadoes_Mulatto_Girl.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="http://static.newworldencyclopedia.org/pskins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a> </div> <i>The Barbadoes Mulatto Girl,</i> after Agostino Brunias, 1779. </div> </div> </div> <p>Large numbers of <a href="/entry/Celts" title="Celts">Celtic</a> people, mainly from <a href="/entry/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and <a href="/entry/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, went to Barbados as indentured servants. Over the next several centuries the Celtic population was used as a buffer between the Anglo-Saxon plantation owners and the larger <a href="/entry/Africa" title="Africa">African</a> population, variously serving as members of the Colonial militia and playing a strong role as allies of the larger African slave population in a long string of colonial rebellions. As well, in 1659, the English shipped many Irishmen and Scots off to Barbados as slaves, and <a href="/entry/James_II_of_England" title="James II of England">King James II</a> and others of his dynasty also sent Scots and English to Barbados: for example, after the crushing of the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685. The modern descendants of this original slave population are sometimes derisively referred to as Red Legs, or locally &quot;ecky becky,&quot; and are some of the poorest inhabitants of modern Barbados. There has also been large-scale intermarriage between the African and Celtic populations on the islands.</p> <p>With the increased implementation of slave codes, which created differential treatment between Africans and the white settlers, the island became increasingly unattractive to poor whites. Black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. However, an increasingly repressive legal system caused the gap between the treatment of typically white indentured servants and black slaves to widen. Imported slaves became much more attractive for the rich planters who would increasingly dominate the island not only economically but also politically. Some have speculated that, because the Africans could withstand tropical diseases and the climate much better than the white slave population, the white population decreased. This is inconsistent with the fact that many poor whites simply immigrated to neighboring islands and remained in tropical climates. Nevertheless, as those poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so, and with the increased importation of African slaves, Barbados turned from mainly Celtic in the seventeenth century to overwhelmingly black by the nineteenth century.</p> <p>As the <a href="/entry/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a> industry developed into its main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates that replaced the smallholdings of the early British settlers. Some of the displaced farmers moved to British colonies in North America, most notably <a href="/entry/South_Carolina" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a>. To work the plantations, West Africans were transported and enslaved on Barbados and other Caribbean islands. The <a href="/entry/Slave_trade" title="Slave trade">slave trade</a> ceased in 1804. In 1816, the continuation of slavery caused the largest major slave rebellion in the island's history. One thousand people died in the revolt for freedom, with 144 slaves executed and 123 deported by the king's army. Slavery was abolished in the British Empire 18 years later in 1834. In Barbados and the rest of the British West Indian colonies, full emancipation from slavery was preceded by an apprenticeship period that lasted six years.</p> <p>However, plantation owners and merchants of British descent still dominated local politics, owing to the high income qualification required for voting. More than 70 percent of the population, many of them un-enfranchised women, were excluded from the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that the descendants of emancipated slaves began a movement for political rights. One of the leaders of this movement, Sir Grantley Adams, founded the Barbados Labour Party, then known as the Barbados Progressive League, in 1938. Though a staunch supporter of the monarchy, Adams and his party demanded more rights for the poor and for the people. Progress toward a more democratic government in Barbados was made in 1942, when the exclusive income qualification was lowered and women were given the right to vote. By 1949, governmental control was wrested from the planters and, in 1958, Adams became Premier of Barbados.</p> <p>From 1958 to 1962, Barbados was one of the ten members of the West Indies Federation, an organization doomed by nationalistic attitudes and by the fact that its members, as colonies of Britain, held limited legislative power. Adams served as its first and only &quot;Prime Minister,&quot; but his leadership failed in attempts to form similar unions, and his continued defense of the monarchy was used by his opponents as evidence that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country. Errol Walton Barrow, a fervent reformer, became the new people's advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the Democratic Labour Party as a liberal alternative to Adams' conservative government. Barrow instituted many progressive social programs, such as free education for all Barbadians, and the School Meals system. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.</p> <p>With the Federation dissolved, Barbados had reverted to its former status, that of a self-governing colony. The island negotiated its own independence at a constitutional conference with the <a href="/entry/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in June 1966. After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados finally became an independent state within the Commonwealth of Nations on November 30, 1966, with Errol Barrow its first Prime Minister.</p> <p><a name="Politics" id="Politics"></a></p> <h2><span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2> <div class="thumb tright"> <div class="thumbinner" style="width:277px;"> <a href="/entry/Image:Barbados_beach.jpg" class="image" title="The beach in Barbados."><img alt="The beach in Barbados." src="http://static.newworldencyclopedia.org/thumb/9/96/Barbados_beach.jpg/275px-Barbados_beach.jpg" width="275" height="206" border="0" class="thumbimage" /></a> <div class="thumbcaption"> <div class="magnify"> <a href="/entry/Image:Barbados_beach.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="http://static.newworldencyclopedia.org/pskins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a> </div>The beach in Barbados. </div> </div> </div> <p>Politics in Barbados takes place in the framework of a parliamentary representative democratic monarchy, whereby the Prime Minister is the head of government of a pluriform multi-party system. The Executive power is exercised by the government while the Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the Parliament. The political system is dominated by two main parties, the Barbados Labour Party and the Democratic Labour Party. The Judiciary of Barbados is independent of the executive and the legislature. Jurisprudence is based on English common law.</p> <p>The bicameral Parliament of Barbados consists of the House of Assembly and the Senate. The 30 members of the House are elected by universal suffrage to five-year terms. Elections may be called at any time the government wishes to seek a new mandate or if the government suffers a vote of no-confidence in Parliament. The Senate's 21 members are appointed by the governor general12 with the advice of the prime minister, two with the advice of the leader of the opposition, and seven at the governor general's discretion.</p> <p>After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados became an independent state maintaining full diplomatic ties to the Commonwealth of Nations on November 30, 1966. The overall constitutional safeguards for nationals of Barbados include: Freedom of speech, press, worship, movement, and association. The present government is proposing that Barbados become a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, with a ceremonial president replacing the British Sovereign. This issue is still being hotly debated, as the island has been governmentally autonomous for decades and the Crown's position is strictly nominal.</p> <p>Barbados is a full and participating member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy (CSME), the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ), which currently pertains only to Barbados and <a href="/entry/Guyana" title="Guyana">Guyana</a> but is expected to replace the UK Privy Council for the entire English-speaking Caribbean eventually, and the Association of Caribbean States (ACS).</p> <p>There are two major and long-standing parties in Barbadosthe Barbados Labour Party (BLP) and the Democratic Labour Party (DLP). Recent times have seen the dissolution of a third partythe National Democratic Party (NDP)and the creation of another, the People's National Party (PNP). Despite initial historical disparity (the BLP was once conservative and the DLP liberal), their modern incarnations are all moderate and have no major ideological differences. Electoral contests and political disputes often have personal overtones and voter sway tends to be based on tradition. The major political problems facing Barbados today are in promoting economic growth: Creating jobs, encouraging agricultural diversification, attracting small industry, and promoting tourism.</p> <p>The ruling BLP was decisively returned to power in January 1999 elections, winning 26 seats, (of the then) available 28 seats in the Parliament with the DLP only winning two seats.</p> <p>Barbados has been represented by the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) for 14 years, since the year 1993.</p> <p><a name="Economy" id="Economy"></a></p> <h2><span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2> <div class="thumb tright"> <div class="thumbinner" style="width:277px;"> <a href="/entry/Image:Bottom_Bay%2C_Barbados.jpg" class="image" title="Bottom Bay, Barbados."><img alt="Bottom Bay, Barbados." src="http://static.newworldencyclopedia.org/thumb/e/e1/Bottom_Bay%2C_Barbados.jpg/275px-Bottom_Bay%2C_Barbados.jpg" width="275" height="206" border="0" class="thumbimage" /></a> <div class="thumbcaption"> <div class="magnify"> <a href="/entry/Image:Bottom_Bay%2C_Barbados.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="http://static.newworldencyclopedia.org/pskins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a> </div>Bottom Bay, Barbados. </div> </div> </div> <p>Historically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on <a href="/entry/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugarcane</a> cultivation and related activities, but in recent years it has diversified into the manufacturing and tourism sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become increasingly important foreign exchange earners, and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector. In recent years the Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound. Since the late 1990s, the island has seen a construction boom, with the development and redevelopment of hotels, office complexes, and homes.</p> <p>Offshore finance and informatics are important foreign exchange earners, and there is also a light manufacturing sector. The government continues its efforts to reduce the unacceptably high unemployment rate which it met in the 1990s, encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize remaining state-owned enterprises.</p> <p>The main factors responsible for the improvement in economic activity include an expansion in the number of tourist arrivals, an increase in manufacturing, and an increase in sugar production. Recently, offshore <a href="/entry/Banking" class="mw-redirect" title="Banking">banking</a> and financial services also have become an important source of foreign exchange and economic growth.</p> <p>Economic growth has led to net increases in employment in the tourism sector, as well as in construction and other services sub-sectors of the economy. The public service remains Barbados' largest single employer. Total labor force has increased from 126,000 in 1993 to 140,000 persons in 2000, and unemployment has dropped significantly from over 20 percent in the early 1990s to 9.3 percent at the end of 2000.</p> <p>The economy of Barbados is susceptible to various issues. Fluctuations in tourist arrivals has a direct effect on the Barbados economy. In order to stabilize tourism the government has announced an initiative to host one major sporting event per year. In 2006, it was announced that the Sandy Lane Beach Hotel will host the Golf world cup. For 2007 several matches of the Cricket World Cup will be held on the island and the government promises that more big events will be lined up for 2008 and 2009. The Barbados government has also pursued &quot;home porting&quot; agreements with several cruise-lines. As part of the deal, the Barbados government negotiates with cruise-lines, tourists fly to Barbados and are transported to the Deep Water Harbor in Bridgetown to begin their Caribbean cruise.</p> <p><a name="Natural_resources" id="Natural_resources"></a></p> <h3><span class="mw-headline">Natural resources</span></h3> <p>Barbados has considered the sea surrounding the island a natural resource. For centuries oceangoing fleets from Barbados would haul fresh <a href="/entry/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> and other marine species. Barbados was best known for the Flying Fish which at one time more heavily inhabited the warm waters around the island.</p> <p>Global pricing on fossil fuels also has a direct impact on the Barbados economy. Barbados remains one of the few islands in the Caribbean with an oil/gas field within its territory. The island currently has an exploration agreement with U.S.-based PhilipsConoco (and previously Mobil) around the Oistins, town of Christ Church. Oil and gas supplies in Barbados have been considered small and are used most commonly for local consumption to decrease the need to import some of the island's fuel. Under an agreement with neighboring <a href="/entry/Trinidad_and_Tobago" title="Trinidad and Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a> since the 1990s, the governmentowned Barbados National Oil Company allows all crude to be refined via Trinidad and Tobago's booming oil industry. The Trinidad and Tobago government in turn provides an equivalent amount of processed fuel back to Barbados, minus some oil to recoup the cost of refining. The remainder is returned to Barbados in the end product.</p> <p>The Government of Barbados refused to sign on to a deal with many of the other Caribbean islands and <a href="/entry/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> known as PetroCaribe, citing it could force local privately owned companies out of business, since PetroCaribe partially seeks to re-nationalize all energy infrastructure. Another factor was that the Barbados economy could not forecast future costs from joining in PetroCaribe.</p> <p>In an effort to further decrease the island's overdependence on oil, the Government of Barbados is investing in technologies to harness wind power for energy, as well as possibly using more of the islands' unused sugar cane for Ethanol fuel energy, similar to Brazil.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p> <p><a name="Weather_impacts" id="Weather_impacts"></a></p> <h3><span class="mw-headline">Weather impacts</span></h3> <p>In 1994-95, Barbados found itself vulnerable to large changes in the earth's weather patterns. A (one in 150 year) drought gripped the entire island, preventing some residents from drawing adequate water supply and delivering a huge blow to the island's <a href="/entry/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> industry. In order to prevent a repeat of this event, the island entered into an agreement with the Ionics Co. to build a desalination water plant.

The Bajan, or Barbadian Creole, dialect is an iconic part of the culture. But English is still the official language, reflecting centuries of British rule.</p> <p>The island's British influence stretches back to 1625, when Captain John Powell claimed it in the name of <a href="/entry/James_I_of_England" title="James I of England">King James I</a>. The first colonists arrived two years later, founding a settlement of 80 civilians and ten slaves. Early on, Barbados adopted the British style of government, creating a Parliamentary democracy in 1639. During the colonial period, all members of the Legislative Assembly were white. After slavery was abolished in 1838, non-whites quickly began to play a role in the island's government, with the first minority member elected in 1843. Although Barbados gained full independence from Britain in 1966, it has retained its governmental style and remains a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.</p> <p>In addition to government, the British passed down their love of cricket. The most popular sport on Barbados, its cricket team has won numerous regional matches. Many players on the team go on to success on the West Indies team to compete in international games. One of the most highly regarded cricket players of all time, Sir Garfield Sobers, is a Barbados native.</p> <p>The country's architecture pays further testament to Britain, with many historic buildings still standing. In addition to traditional wood and stone, <a href="/entry/Coral" title="Coral">coral</a> was also used in construction, lending a unique Barbadian flair. Jacobean, Georgian, and Victorian styles dominate. Slaves constructed many of these buildings, as well as their own chattel houses, and were thus an integral part of the island's architectural legacy. Built of wood, chattel houses were set atop blocks instead of permanent foundations so they could be easily moved from place to place. The vivid colors of these chattel houses exhibits <a href="/entry/West_Africa" class="mw-redirect" title="West Africa">West African</a> influence.</p> <p>Religion plays an important role in life on the island. With its long British ties, the <a href="/entry/Anglican" class="mw-redirect" title="Anglican">Anglican</a> church serves the largest segment of the population. However, Roman Catholic, <a href="/entry/Baptist" class="mw-redirect" title="Baptist">Baptist</a>, <a href="/entry/Methodist" class="mw-redirect" title="Methodist">Methodist</a>, and other Christian denominations also support congregations.

Smaller <a href="/entry/Judaism" title="Judaism">Jewish</a>, <a href="/entry/Hinduism" title="Hinduism">Hindu</a>, and <a href="/entry/Islam" title="Islam">Muslim</a> communities add some religious diversity.</p> <p>In addition to Gospelfest, Barbados holds many other carnivals and festivals. The Landship is a Barbadian tradition. It mimics and parodies the Royal Navy, while it incorporates music, dance, and games. The largest and most important festival in Barbados is <i>Crop Over,</i> which celebrates the end of the sugarcane harvest. Lasting three weeks, it includes fairs, parades, and contests.</p> <p>The <a href="/entry/Music" title="Music">music</a> of Barbados is an important part of the country's culture.

As in other Caribbean countries, cricket is a favorite sport. In addition to several warm-up matches and six &quot;Super Eight&quot; matches, Barbados hosted the final of the 2007 Cricket World Cup. The best Barbadian Cricket players go on to play for the West Indies Cricket Team. The West Indian cricket team, also known colloquially as <i>The Windies</i> or <i>The West Indies,</i> is a multi-national cricket team representing a sporting confederation of a dozen English-speaking <a href="/entry/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> countries and British dependencies that form the British West Indies.</p> <p>In golf, the Barbados Open is an annual stop on the European Seniors Tour. In December 2006 the WGC-World Cup took place at the country's Sandy Lane resort on the Country Club course, an eighteen-hole course designed by Tom Fazio.</p> <p>The Barbados national football team, nicknamed <i>Bajan Pride,</i> is the national team of Barbados and is controlled by the Barbados Football Association. It has never qualified for a major international tournament. It came close to qualifying for the 2005 Gold Cup as it hosted the Digicel Cup finals for the Caribbean that acted as Gold Cup qualifiers, but finished fourth of the four teams. In 2001, it surprised many by making the semifinal round of the 2002 World Cup Qualifiers.
