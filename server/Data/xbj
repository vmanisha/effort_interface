The automotive industry should be given credit for having organized recycling early on.&nbsp; The recycling process is simple and 70 percent of the battery’s weight is reusable lead.&nbsp;As a result, over 50 percent of the lead supply comes from recycled batteries.&nbsp;Other battery types are not being returned as readily as lead acid, and several organizations are working on programs to make collection of spent batteries more convenient. Only 20 to 40 percent of cellular phone and consumer batteries are currently recycled.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main objective for recycling batteries is to prevent hazardous materials from entering landfills. Lead acid and nickel-cadmium batteries are of special concern, and although Li-ion is less harmful, the aim is to include all batteries in the recycling programs.&nbsp;Do not store old lead acid batteries in households where children play. Simply touching the lead poles can be harmful. Read more about the <a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/health_concerns">Health Concerns with Batteries</a>.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even though they are environmentally unfriendly, lead acid batteries continue to hold a strong market niche. Wheeled mobility and UPS systems could not run as economically if it were not for this reliable battery. NiCd also continues to hold a critical position among rechargeable batteries. Large flooded NiCds start the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) of commercial airplanes and power sightseeing boats in rivers of larger cities, pollution-free.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Toxic batteries will continue to be with us for a while longer because we have no practical alternatives. There is nothing wrong in using these batteries as long as we properly dispose of them. Europe banned NiCds in consumer products because there is a suitable replacement, the NiMH battery. Controlling the disposal of NiCds from consumer products is difficult because many users do not know that the retiring equipment includes this battery. The long-term environmental damage if the world’s NiCds were improperly disposed of could be devastating.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let’s look at what happens when NiCds are carelessly disposed of in landfills. The metallic cylinder of the cell eventually begins to corrode and the cadmium gradually dissolves, seeping into the water supply. Once such contamination begins, the authorities have few options to stop the carnage. Our oceans already show traces of cadmium (along with aspirin, penicillin and antidepressants) but scientists are not certain of its origin. Regulatory discipline will lead to a cleaner environment for the next generations.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nickel-metal-hydride batteries contain nickel and electrolyte, which are considered semi-toxic. If no disposal service is available in an area, individual NiMH batteries can be discarded with other household waste. When accumulating 10 or more batteries, the user should consider disposing of the packs in a secure waste landfill. The better alternative is bringing the spent batteries to a neighborhood drop-off bin for recycling.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Primary lithium batteries contain metallic lithium that reacts violently when in contact with moisture and the batteries must be disposed of appropriately. If thrown in the landfill in a charged state, heavy equipment operating on top could crush the cases and the exposed lithium would cause a fire. Landfill fires are difficult to extinguish and can burn for years underground. Before recycling, apply a full discharge to consume the lithium content. Non-rechargeable lithium batteries are used in military combat, as well as watches, hearing aids and memory backup. Li-ion for cell phones and laptops do not contain metallic lithium.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In North America,Toxco and Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation (RBRC) collect spent batteries and recycle them. While Toxco has its own recycling facilities, RBRC is in charge of collecting batteries and sending them to recycling organizations. Toxco in Trail, British Columbia, claims to be the only company in the world that recycles large lithium batteries. They receive spent batteries from oil drilling in Nigeria, Indonesia and other places. Toxco also recycles retired lithium batteries from the Minuteman missile silos and tons of Li-ion from the war in Iraq. Other divisions at Toxco recycle nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal-hydride, lead, mercury, alkaline and more.</font></p> <p> Europe and Asia are also active in recycling spent batteries. Among other recycling companies, Sony and Sumitomo Metal in Japan and Unicore in Belgium have developed technology to retrieve cobalt and other precious metals from spent lithium ion batteries. The raw material lithium can also be retrieved and re-used repeatedly.

Collection centers place lead acid, nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal-hydride and lithium‑ion into designated drums, sacks or boxes. Battery recyclers claim that if a steady stream of batteries, sorted by chemistry, were available at no charge, recycling would be profitable.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The recycling process generally begins by removing the combustible material, such as plastics and insulation, with a gas-fired thermal oxidizer. The plant’s scrubber eliminates the polluting particles created by a burning process before releasing them into the atmosphere. This leaves the clean and naked cells with their valuable metal content. The cells are then chopped into small pieces and heated until the metal liquefies. Non-metallic substances are burned off; leaving a black slag on top that a slag arm removes. The alloys settle according to weight and are skimmed off like cream from raw milk while in liquid form.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cadmium is relatively light and vaporizes at high temperatures. In a process that appears like a pan of water boiling over, a fan blows the cadmium vapor into a large tube cooled with water mist, and the vapors condense to produce cadmium that is 99.95&nbsp;percent pure.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some recyclers do not separate the metals on site but pour the liquid metals directly into what the industry refers to as “pigs” (65 pounds, 24kg) or “hogs” (2,000 pounds, 746kg). Other battery recyclers use the 7-pound nuggets (3.17kg). The pigs, hogs and nuggets are then shipped to metal recovery plants where they are used to produce nickel, chromium and iron for stainless steel and other high-end products.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Toxco uses liquid nitrogen to freeze lithium-based batteries before shredding, crushing and removal of the lithium, as well as other battery components. The lithium is dissolved in a solution to make the metal non-reactive and is sold for producing lubricating greases. Similarly, the cobalt is separated, collected and sold.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Battery recycling is energy-intensive, and it takes 6 to 10 times more energy to reclaim metals from recycled batteries as it does to produce the materials through other means, including mining. Let’s explore who pays for the recycling of batteries.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each country imposes their own rules and fees to make recycling feasible. In North America, some recycling plants invoice on weight, and the rates vary according to chemistry. Nickel-metal-hydride yields the best return, as recycling produces enough nickel to pay for the process. The highest recycling fees apply to nickel-cadmium and lithium‑ion, because the demand for cadmium is low and lithium‑ion contains little in retrievable metal.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rather than calculate the cost according to battery chemistry, some countries deal in tonnage. The flat cost to recycle a ton of batteries is $1,000 to $2,000, and Europe hopes to achieve a cost per ton of $300. Ideally, this would include transportation, but moving and handling the goods is expected to double the overall cost. To simplify transportation, Europe is setting up several smaller processing plants in strategic geographic locations.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Manufacturers, agencies and governments still must provide subsidies to support the battery recycling programs. This is underwritten by a tax added to each manufactured cell. RBRC receives funding from such a program.</font><br /> &nbsp;</p> <table border="0" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" style="width: 550px; "> <tbody> <tr> <td style="background-color: rgb(224, 224, 224); "> <br /> <strong>Caution:</strong></td> <td style="background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238); "> Under no circumstances should batteries be incinerated, as fire can cause an explosion.

Data werederived from the health care proxy and from the Mount SinaiSchool of Medicine’s Blood Product Checklist for Jehovah’sWitness Patients. Variables of interest included age, race,parity, and antenatal and perinatal complications. <strong>RESULTS:</strong> A total of 61 patients were identified. Of these,39.3% agreed to accept a variety of donated blood products,9.8% would accept donated packed red blood cells, and50.1% would accept neither from a homologous donor. Withrespect to nonstored autologous blood, 55% of respondentswould accept either intraoperative normovolemic hemodilutionor transfusion of their own blood obtained by a cellsalvage system. No significant differences in responses werenoted for any of the above-mentioned variables. <strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> This review refutes the commonly held beliefthat all Jehovah’s Witnesses refuse to accept blood or any ofits products. In this population of pregnant women, themajority were willing to accept some form of blood orblood products. This information can be used to helphealth care providers counsel a patient when she is initiallyfaced with considering these issues and may help to removethe stigma of accepting one of the options.

Many Jehovah’s Witnesses feel thataccepting a blood transfusion will lead them to eternaldamnation. A patient’s self-determination, or autonomy,allows her to make decisions regarding her care. The decisionto refuse blood or blood products has been upheld incourt. This brings a new twist to the physician’s obligationto “do no harm.” When one undertakes the care of one ofthese patients, it is important to understand the ethical andmedicolegal ramifications. The decision to be the primarycaregivers can only be made once the physicians havedecided they can let the patient die when all other optionshave been exhausted. This commentary discusses the ethicalconcerns and reviews the alternatives available to aJehovah’s Witness. (Obstet Gynecol 2003;102:173– 80.&copy; 2003 by The American College of Obstetricians andGynecologists.)Several unique issues arise when health professionalsagree to provide obstetric care to observant Jehovah’sWitnesses. It has been shown that if such women havean obstetric hemorrhage, they are at a 44-fold increasedrisk of maternal mortality.1 Both ethical and medicalconcerns should be considered before undertaking thecare of one of these patients. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="status"> </td> <td class="rating"></td> <td class="bibliographic_entry">Harnett MJ, Miller AD, Hurley RJ, Bhavani-Shankar K.<em>Pregnancy, labour and delivery in a Jehovah's Witness with esophageal varices and thrombocytopenia</em>.Can J Anaesth 2000; 47:1253-5. <a href="#" onclick="toggle_abstract(355); return false;">Abstract</a> <div class="abstract" id="abstract_355" style="display: none"> <strong>PURPOSE:</strong> An increasing number of women with cirrhosis are conceiving and carrying their pregnancies to term. However, the maternal mortality rate remains high (10-61%). This case report describes the management of a parturient with esophageal varices and thrombocytopenia. She was also a Jehovah's Witness. <br /> <strong> CLINICAL FEATURES:</strong> A 25-yr-old Jehovah's Witness parturient with portal hypertension and esophageal varices secondary to cryptogenic cirrhosis was referred to our obstetrical unit at eight weeks gestation. In addition she was thrombocytopenic with platelet counts ranging from 42,000-67,000 x microl(-1). Her esophageal varices were banded prophylactically on three occasions during her pregnancy. Magnetic resonance imaging at 32 wk gestation showed extensive caput medusa and dominant midline varix. Therefore, the planned mode of delivery was changed from Cesarean section which could result in massive hemorrhage, to elective induction of labour with an assisted second stage. The patient refused any blood product transfusion except acute hemodilution and cell saving if necessary during labour and delivery. Despite elaborate preparations for a planned vaginal delivery, she underwent an unanticipated rapid labour. Spinal analgesia was provided to facilitate smooth assisted vacuum delivery. <br /> <strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> Multidisciplinary care is the key for a successful outcome in parturients with cirrhosis. Periodic examination and banding of esophageal varices is recommended during pregnancy. Active consideration should be given to availing of the benefits of regional anesthesia. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="status"> </td> <td class="rating"></td> <td class="bibliographic_entry">Laird R, Carabine U.<em>Recombinant factor VIIa for major obstetric haemorrhage in a Jehovah's Witness</em>.Int J Obstet Anesth 2008; 17:193-4.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="status"> </td> <td class="rating"></td> <td class="bibliographic_entry">Marsh JCW, Elebute MO, Bevan DH.<em>Special circumstances: Jehovah’s Witnesses, those who refuse blood transfusion and/or consent in A Textbook of PostPartum Hemorrhage (ed C.

According to&nbsp;<em>The Daily,&nbsp;</em>JoAnn Smith, the former undersecretary of agriculture appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1989, is accused of pushing the product. Before being appointed to her government position, Smith was the president of both the Florida and National Cattlemen’s Associations.&nbsp;The government’s approval of pink slime led to a windfall of hundreds of millions of dollars for BPI.</p> <p>Moreover, after stepping down from her government job in 1993, Smith was appointed to BPI’s board of directors, where she was paid at least $1.2 million over the following years.</p> <p>“Scientists in D.C. were pressured to approve this stuff with minimal safety approval,” Zirnstein claims.</p> <p><img style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.11NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMzEyNDA*NTY4MzEmcHQ9MTMzMTI*MDQ2MDA3NSZwPSZkPSZnPTImbz*wNjYxNTZkODc3OGQ*ZWJlOGEyNjVkZTI4/Y2ViYzA3MyZvZj*w.gif" alt="" width="0" height="0" border="0" /><object id="kaltura_player_1331240456" width="392" height="221" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"></param><param name="allowNetworking" value="all"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="flashVars" value="autoPlay=false&amp;screensLayer.startScreenOverId=startScreen&amp;screensLayer.startScreenId=startScreen"></param><param name="src" value="http://cdnapi.kaltura.com/index.php/kwidget/wid/0_z6n7pt8e/uiconf_id/5590821"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><param name="allownetworking" value="all"></param><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"></param><param name="flashvars" value="autoPlay=false&amp;screensLayer.startScreenOverId=startScreen&amp;screensLayer.startScreenId=startScreen"></param><embed id="kaltura_player_1331240456" width="392" height="221" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://cdnapi.kaltura.com/index.php/kwidget/wid/0_z6n7pt8e/uiconf_id/5590821" allowscriptaccess="always" allownetworking="all" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="autoPlay=false&amp;screensLayer.startScreenOverId=startScreen&amp;screensLayer.startScreenId=startScreen" /><a <=""><p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/RBkwUt-bqIo" frameborder="0" width="400" height="233"></iframe></p></a> <div> <a <=""><em>If you enjoyed this post, make sure you </em></a> <em><a href="http://morallowground.com/feed/">subscribe to my RSS feed</a>! </em> </div> <p align="right"><b>By <a href="http://morallowground.com/author/brett/" title="Posts by Brett Wilkins" rel="author">Brett Wilkins</a></b></p> <div id="commentblock"> <h3 class="comments">Readers Comments (8)</h3> <ol class="commentlist" id="singlecomments"> <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1 parent" id="comment-13246"> <div id="div-comment-13246" class="comment-body"> <div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt="" src="http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b6d6184e5287400d6ab5d4927370fe41?s=32&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fmorallowground.com%2Fwp-includes%2Fimages%2Fblank.gif&amp;r=R" class="avatar avatar-32 photo" height="32" width="32" /> <cite class="fn">Stephen Ogley</cite> <span class="says">says:</span> </div> <div class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> <a href="http://morallowground.com/2012/03/08/usda-whistleblower-gerald-zirnstein-70-of-us-supermarket-ground-beef-contains-ammonia-treated-pink-slime/#comment-13246"> March 9, 2012 at 12:33 pm</a> </div> <p>Sensational misrepresentation.

Pink slime isn’t treated with ammonia, it’s treated with ammonium hydroxide, which is very different. It’s a chemical that occurs naturally in the body and is an ingredient that is used in some baked goods. When you did chemistry at school, did they teach you that sodium is deadly, chlorine is deadly but sodium chloride (salt) is perfectly safe?</p> <p>Propylene glycol is not the same as ethylene glycol. Just because they both have ‘glycol’ in the name doesn’t mean they have the same effect. Propylene glycol is a safe ingredient used in sauces, glazes, bagels and hotcakes. </p> <p>Quoting incorrect facts helps no one.</p> <div class="reply"> <a class="comment-reply-link" href="/2012/03/08/usda-whistleblower-gerald-zirnstein-70-of-us-supermarket-ground-beef-contains-ammonia-treated-pink-slime/?replytocom=13252#respond" onclick="return addComment.moveForm(&quot;div-comment-13252&quot;, &quot;13252&quot;, &quot;respond&quot;, &quot;17548&quot;)">Reply &raquo;</a> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment odd alt depth-4 parent" id="comment-13257"> <div id="div-comment-13257" class="comment-body"> <div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt="" src="http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c056094e3e2327fd331f2a491fcbe953?s=32&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fmorallowground.com%2Fwp-includes%2Fimages%2Fblank.gif&amp;r=R" class="avatar avatar-32 photo" height="32" width="32" /> <cite class="fn">Rachael</cite> <span class="says">says:</span> </div> <div class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> <a href="http://morallowground.com/2012/03/08/usda-whistleblower-gerald-zirnstein-70-of-us-supermarket-ground-beef-contains-ammonia-treated-pink-slime/#comment-13257"> March 9, 2012 at 7:52 pm</a> </div> <p>Dude. Your grandmother called it stock because it was stock. A person who wants to make stock always boils bones in order to make it. That’s what you do. The flavor and nutrients comes from the bone marrow. Duh. Whether a thousand years ago or today, that’s how stock is made if it’s real stock. It’s what stock is. Otherwise, it’s broth.</p> <p>And to say that ‘well, my grandma gave us stock made from boiled bones, therefore chemically treated “meat trimmings” is just fine to eat because the USDA says so’ is a ridiculous way to justify such a thing. The dots don’t connect. If you want to eat things that shouldn’t actually even be called food, go ahead, but the rest of us will continue to object.

Philosophical and Historical Motivation</a></h2> <p> The mathematical theory of games was invented by John von Neumann andOskar Morgenstern (<a href="#Neu47">1944</a>). For reasons to be discussed later, limitations in their mathematicalframework initially made the theory applicable only under special andlimited conditions. This situation has dramatically changed, in ways wewill examine as we go along, over the past six decades, as theframework has been deepened and generalized. Refinements are still beingmade, and we will review a few outstanding problems thatlie along the advancing front edge of these developments towards theend of the article. However, since at least the late 1970s it has beenpossible to say with confidence that game theory is the most importantand useful tool in the analyst's kit whenever she confronts situationsin which what counts as one agent's best action (for her) depends onexpectations about what one or more other agents will do, and whatcounts as their best actions (for them) similarly depend onexpectations about her. </p> <p>Despite the fact that game theory has been rendered mathematically andlogically systematic only since 1944, game-theoretic insightscan be found among commentators going backto ancient times. For example, in two of Plato's texts, the<em>Laches</em> and the <em>Symposium</em>, Socrates recalls anepisode from the Battle of Delium that some commentators haveinterpreted (probably anachronistically) as involving the followingsituation. Consider a soldier at the front, waiting with his comradesto repulse an enemy attack. It may occur to him that if the defense islikely to be successful, then it isn't very probable that his ownpersonal contribution will be essential. But if he stays, he runs therisk of being killed or wounded—apparently for no point. On theother hand, if the enemy is going to win the battle, then his chancesof death or injury are higher still, and now quite clearly to nopoint, since the line will be overwhelmed anyway. Based on thisreasoning, it would appear that the soldier is better off running awayregardless of who is going to win the battle. Of course, if all of thesoldiers reason this way—as they all apparently <em>should</em>,since they're all in identical situations—then this willcertainly <em>bring about</em> the outcome in which the battle islost. Of course, this point, since it has occurred to us as analysts,can occur to the soldiers too. Does this give them a reason forstaying at their posts? Just the contrary: the greater the soldiers'fear that the battle will be lost, the greater their incentive to getthemselves out of harm's way. And the greater the soldiers' beliefthat the battle will be won, without the need of any particularindividual's contributions, the less reason they have to stay andfight. If each soldier <em>anticipates</em> this sort of reasoning onthe part of the others, all will quickly reason themselves into apanic, and their horrified commander will have a rout on his handsbefore the enemy has even fired a shot.</p> <p>Long before game theory had come along to show analysts how to thinkabout this sort of problem systematically, it had occurred to someactual military leaders and influenced their strategies. Thus theSpanish conqueror Cortez, when landing in Mexico with a small forcewho had good reason to fear their capacity to repel attack from thefar more numerous Aztecs, removed the risk that his troops might thinktheir way into a retreat by burning the ships on which they hadlanded. With retreat having thus been rendered physically impossible,the Spanish soldiers had no better course of action but to stand andfight—and, furthermore, to fight with as much determination asthey could muster. Better still, from Cortez's point of view, hisaction had a discouraging effect on the motivation of the Aztecs. Hetook care to burn his ships very visibly, so that the Aztecs would besure to see what he had done. They then reasoned as follows: Anycommander who could be so confident as to willfully destroy his ownoption to be prudent if the battle went badly for him must have goodreasons for such extreme optimism. It cannot be wise to attack anopponent who has a good reason (whatever, exactly, it might be) forbeing sure that he can't lose. The Aztecs therefore retreated into thesurrounding hills, and Cortez had his victory bloodlessly.</p> <p>These situations as recalled by Plato and as vividly acted upon byCortez have a common and interesting underlying logic. Notice that thesoldiers are not motivated to retreat <em>just</em>, or even mainly,by their rational assessment of the dangers of battle and by theirself-interest. Rather, they discover a sound reason to run away byrealizing that what it makes sense for them to do depends on what itwill make sense for others to do, and that all of the others cannotice this too. Even a quite brave soldier may prefer to run ratherthan heroically, but pointlessly, die trying to stem the oncoming tideall by himself. Thus we could imagine, without contradiction, acircumstance in which an army, all of whose members are brave, fleesat top speed before the enemy makes a move. If the soldiers really<em>are</em> brave, then this surely isn't the outcome any of themwanted; each would have preferred that all stand and fight. What wehave here, then, is a case in which the <em>interaction</em> of manyindividually rational decision-making processes—one process persoldier—produces an outcome intended by no one. (Most armies tryto avoid this problem just as Cortez did. Since they can't usuallymake retreat <em>physically</em> impossible, they make it<em>economically</em> impossible: they shoot deserters. Then standingand fighting is each soldier's individually rational course of actionafter all, because the cost of running is sure to be at least as highas the cost of staying.)</p> <p>Another classic source that invites this sequence of reasoning isfound in Shakespeare's <em>Henry V</em>. During the Battle ofAgincourt Henry decided to slaughter his French prisoners, in fullview of the enemy and to the surprise of his subordinates, whodescribe the action as being out of moral character. The reasons Henrygives allude to parametric considerations: he is afraid that theprisoners may free themselves and threaten his position. However, agame theorist might have furnished him with supplementary strategic(and similarly prudential, though perhaps not moral)justification. His own troops observe that the prisoners have beenkilled, and observe that the enemy has observed this. Therefore, theyknow what fate will await them at the enemy's hand if they don'twin. Metaphorically, but very effectively, their boats have beenburnt. The slaughter of the prisoners plausibly sent a signal to thesoldiers of both sides, thereby changing their incentives in ways thatfavoured English prospects for victory.</p> <p>These examples might seem to be relevant only for those who findthemselves in sordid situations of cut-throat competition. Perhaps,one might think, it is important for generals, politicians,businesspeople and others whose jobs involve manipulation of others,but the philosopher should only deplore its amorality. Such aconclusion would be highly premature, however. The study ofthe <em>logic</em> that governs the interrelationships amongstincentives, strategic interactions and outcomes has been fundamentalin modern political philosophy, since centuries before anyone had anexplicit name for this sort of logic. Philosophers share with socialscientists the need to be able to represent and systematically modelnot only what they think people normatively <em>ought to</em> do, butwhat they often <em>actually</em> do in interactive situations.</p> <p>Hobbes's <em>Leviathan</em> is often regarded as the founding work inmodern political philosophy, the text that began the continuing roundof analyses of the function and justification of the state and itsrestrictions on individual liberties. The core of Hobbes's reasoningcan be given quite straightforwardly as follows. The best situationfor all people is one in which each is free to do as she pleases. (Onemay or may not agree with this as a matter of psychology, but it isHobbes's assumption.) Often, such free people will wish to cooperatewith one another in order to carry out projects that would beimpossible for an individual acting alone. But if there are anyimmoral or amoral agents around, they will notice that their interestsmight at least sometimes be best served by getting the benefits fromcooperation and not returning them. Suppose, for example, that youagree to help me build my house in return for my promise to help youbuild yours. After my house is finished, I can make your labour freeto me simply by reneging on my promise. I then realize, however, thatif this leaves you with no house, you will have an incentive to takemine. This will put me in constant fear of you, and force me to spendvaluable time and resources guarding myself against you. I can bestminimize these costs by striking first and killing you at the firstopportunity. Of course, you can anticipate all of this reasoning byme, and so have good reason to try to beat me to the punch. Since Ican anticipate <em>this</em> reasoning by<em>you</em>, my original fear of you was not paranoid; nor was yoursof me. In fact, neither of us actually needs to be immoral to get thischain of mutual reasoning going; we need only think that there is some<em>possibility</em> that the other might try to cheat on bargains.Once a small wedge of doubt enters any one mind, the incentive inducedby fear of the consequences of being <em>preempted</em>—hitbefore hitting first—quickly becomes overwhelming on bothsides. If either of us has any resources of our own that the othermight want, this murderous logic will take hold long before we are sosilly as to imagine that we could ever actually get as far as makingdeals to help one another build houses in the first place. Left totheir own devices, agents who are at least sometimes narrowlyself-interested will repeatedly fail to derive the benefits ofcooperation, and will instead live in a state of ‘war of allagainst all’, in Hobbes's words. In these circumstances, humanlife, as he vividly and famously put it, will be “solitary, poor,nasty, brutish and short.”</p> <p>Hobbes's proposed solution to this problem was tyranny. The people canhire an agent—a government—whose job is to punish anyonewho breaks any promise. So long as the threatened punishment issufficiently dire—Hobbes thought decapitation generallyappropriate—then the cost of reneging on promises will exceedthe cost of keeping them. The logic here is identical to that used byan army when it threatens to shoot deserters. If all people know thatthese incentives hold for most others, then cooperation will not onlybe possible, but will be the expected norm, and the war of all againstall becomes a general peace.</p> <p>Hobbes pushes the logic of this argument to a very strongconclusion, arguing that it implies not only a government with theright and the power to enforce cooperation, but an‘undivided’ government in which the arbitrary will of asingle ruler must impose absolute obligation on all. Few contemporarypolitical theorists think that the particular steps by which Hobbesreasons his way to this conclusion are both sound and valid. Workingthrough these issues here, however, would carry us away from our topicinto complex details of contractarian political philosophy. What isimportant in the present context is that these details, as they are infact pursued in the contemporary debates, all involve sophisticatedinterpretation of the issues using the resources of modern game theory.Furthermore, Hobbes's most basic point, that the fundamentaljustification for the coercive authority and practices of governmentsis peoples' own need to protect themselves from what game theoristscall ‘social dilemmas’, is accepted by many, if not most,political theorists. Notice that Hobbes has <em>not</em> argued thattyranny is a desirable thing in itself. The structure of his argumentis that the logic of strategic interaction leaves only two generalpolitical outcomes possible: tyranny and anarchy. Sensible agents thenchoose tyranny as the lesser of two evils.</p> <p>The reasoning of the Athenian soldiers, of Cortez, and of Hobbes'spolitical agents has a common logic, one derived from theirsituations. In each case, the aspect of the environment that is mostimportant to the agents' achievement of their preferred outcomes isthe set of expectations and possible reactions to their strategies byother agents. The distinction between acting <em>parametrically</em>on a passive world and acting<em>non-parametrically</em> on a world that tries to act inanticipation of these actions is fundamental. If you wish to kick arock down a hill, you need only concern yourself with the rock's massrelative to the force of your blow, the extent to which it is bondedwith its supporting surface, the slope of the ground on the other sideof the rock, and the expected impact of the collision on yourfoot. The values of all of these variables are independent of yourplans and intentions, since the rock has no interests of its own andtakes no actions to attempt to assist or thwart you. By contrast, ifyou wish to kick a person down the hill, then unless that person isunconscious, bound or otherwise incapacitated, you will likely notsucceed unless you can disguise your plans until it's too late for himto take either evasive or forestalling action. Furthermore, hisprobable responses should be expected to visit costs upon you, whichyou would be wise to consider. Finally, the relative probabilities ofhis responses will depend on his expectations about your probableresponses to his responses. (Consider the difference it will make toboth of your reasoning if one or both of you are armed, or one of youis bigger than the other, or one of you is the other's boss.) Thelogical issues associated with the second sort of situation (kickingthe person as opposed to the rock) are typically much morecomplicated, as a simple hypothetical example will illustrate.</p> <p>Suppose first that you wish to cross a river that is spanned by threebridges. (Assume that swimming, wading or boating across areimpossible.) The first bridge is known to be safe and free ofobstacles; if you try to cross there, you will succeed. The secondbridge lies beneath a cliff from which large rocks sometimes fall. Thethird is inhabited by deadly cobras. Now suppose you wish torank-order the three bridges with respect to their preferability ascrossing-points. Your task here is quite straightforward. The firstbridge is obviously best, since it is safest. To rank-order the othertwo bridges, you require information about their relative levels ofdanger. If you can study the frequency of rock-falls and the movementsof the cobras for awhile, you might be able to calculate that theprobability of your being crushed by a rock at the second bridge is10% and of being struck by a cobra at the third bridge is 20%. Yourreasoning here is strictly parametric because neither the rocks northe cobras are trying to influence your actions, by, for example,concealing their typical patterns of behaviour because they know youare studying them. It is quite obvious what you should do here: crossat the safe bridge. Now let us complicate the situation a bit. Supposethat the bridge with the rocks was immediately before you, while thesafe bridge was a day's difficult hike upstream. Your decision-makingsituation here is slightly more complicated, but it is still strictlyparametric. You would have to decide whether the cost of the long hikewas worth exchanging for the penalty of a 10% chance of being hit by arock. However, this is all you must decide, and your probability of asuccessful crossing is entirely up to you; the environment is notinterested in your plans.</p> <p>However, if we now complicate the situation by adding a non-parametricelement, it becomes much more puzzling. Suppose that you are afugitive of some sort, and waiting on the other side of the river witha gun is your pursuer. She will catch and shoot you, let us suppose,only if she waits at the bridge you try to cross; otherwise, you willescape. As you reason through your choice of bridge, it occurs to youthat she is over there trying to anticipate your reasoning. It willseem that, surely, choosing the safe bridge straight away would be amistake, since that is just where she will expect you, and yourchances of death rise to certainty. So perhaps you should risk therocks, since these odds are much better. But wait … if you canreach this conclusion, your pursuer, who is just as rational andwell-informed as you are, can anticipate that you will reach it, andwill be waiting for you if you evade the rocks. So perhaps you musttake your chances with the cobras; that is what she must least expect.But, then, no … if she expects that you will expect that shewill least expect this, then she will most expect it. This dilemma,you realize with dread, is general: you must do what your pursuerleast expects; but whatever you most expect her to least expect isautomatically what she will most expect. You appear to be trapped inindecision. All that might console you a bit here is that, on theother side of the river, your pursuer is trapped in exactly the samequandary, unable to decide which bridge to wait at because as soon asshe imagines committing to one, she will notice that if she can find abest reason to pick a bridge, you can anticipate that same reason andthen avoid her.</p> <p>We know from experience that, in situations such as this, people donot usually stand and dither in circles forever. As we'll see later,there <em>is</em> a rational solution—that is, a best rationalaction—available to both players. However, until the 1940sneither philosophers nor economists knew how to find itmathematically. As a result, economists were forced to treatnon-parametric influences as if they were complications on parametricones. This is likely to strike the reader as odd, since, as ourexample of the bridge-crossing problem was meant to show,non-parametric features are often fundamental features ofdecision-making problems. Part of the explanation for game theory'srelatively late entry into the field lies in the problems with whicheconomists had historically been concerned. Classical economists, suchas Adam Smith and David Ricardo, were mainly interested in thequestion of how agents in very large markets—wholenations—could interact so as to bring about maximum monetarywealth for themselves. Smith's basic insight, that efficiency is bestmaximized by agents freely seeking mutually advantageous bargains, wasmathematically verified in the twentieth century. However, thedemonstration of this fact applies only in conditions of‘perfect competition,’ that is, when firms face no costsof entry or exit into markets, when there are no economies of scale,and when no agents' actions have unintended side-effects on otheragents' well-being. Economists always recognized that this set ofassumptions is purely an idealization for purposes of analysis, not apossible state of affairs anyone could try (or should want to try) toattain. But until the mathematics of game theory matured near the endof the 1970s, economists had to hope that the more closely a market<em>approximates</em> perfect competition, the more efficient it willbe. No such hope, however, can be mathematically or logicallyjustified in general; indeed, as a strict generalization theassumption was shown to be false as far back as the 1950s.</p> <p>This article is not about the foundations of economics, but it isimportant for understanding the origins and scope of game theory toknow that perfectly competitive markets have built into them a featurethat renders them susceptible to parametric analysis. Because agentsface no entry costs to markets, they will open shop in any givenmarket until competition drives all profits to zero. This implies thatif production costs are fixed and demand is exogenous, then agentshave no options about how much to produce if they are trying tomaximize the differences between their costs and their revenues. Theseproduction levels can be determined separately for each agent, so noneneed pay attention to what the others are doing; each agent treats hercounterparts as passive features of the environment. The other kind ofsituation to which classical economic analysis can be applied withoutrecourse to game theory is that of monopoly. Here, quite obviously,non-parametric considerations drop out, since there is only one agentunder study. However, both perfect and monopolistic competition arevery special and unusual market arrangements. Prior to the advent ofgame theory, therefore, economists were severely limited in the classof circumstances to which they could neatly apply their models.</p> <p>Philosophers share with economists a professional interest in theconditions and techniques for the maximization of human welfare. Inaddition, philosophers have a special concern with the logicaljustification of actions, and often actions must be justified byreference to their expected outcomes. (One tradition in philosophy,utilitarianism, is based on the idea that all justifiable actions mustbe justified in this way.) Without game theory, both of these problemsresist analysis wherever non-parametric aspects are relevant. We willdemonstrate this shortly by reference to the most famous (though notthe most typical) game, the so-called <em>Prisoner's Dilemma</em>, andto other, more typical, games. In doing this, we will need tointroduce, define and illustrate the basic elements and techniques ofgame theory. To this job we therefore now turn.</p> <h2><a name="Bas">2. Basic Elements and Assumptions of Game Theory</a></h2> <h3><a name="Util">2.1 Utility</a></h3> <p>An economic agent is, by definition, an entity with <em>preferences</em>. Gametheorists, like economists and philosophers studying rationaldecision-making, describe these by means of an abstract concept called<em>utility</em>. This refers to some ranking, on some specifiedscale, of the subjective welfare or change in subjective welfare thatan agent derives from an object or an event. By ‘welfare’we refer to some normative index of relative well-being, justified byreference to some background framework. For example, we might evaluatethe relative welfare of countries (which we might model as agents forsome purposes) by reference to their per capita incomes, and we mightevaluate the relative welfare of an animal, in the context ofpredicting and explaining its behavioral dispositions, by reference toits expected evolutionary fitness. In the case of people, it is mosttypical in economics and applications of game theory to evaluate theirrelative welfare by reference to their own implicit or explicitjudgments of it. This is why we referred above to <em>subjective</em>welfare. Consider a person who adores the taste of pickles butdislikes onions. She might be said to associate higher utility withstates of the world in which, all else being equal, she consumes morepickles and fewer onions than with states in which she consumes moreonions and fewer pickles. Examples of this kind suggest that‘utility’ denotes a measure of subjective<em>psychological</em> fulfillment, and this is indeed how the conceptwas generally (though not always) interpreted prior to the 1930s.During that decade, however, economists and philosophers under theinfluence of behaviourism objected to the theoretical use of suchunobservable entities as ‘psychological fulfillmentquotients.’ The economist Paul Samuelson (<a href="#Sam38">1938</a>) therefore set out to define utility in such a way that it becomes apurely technical concept. Since Samuelson's re-definition becamestandard in the 1950s, when we say that an agent acts so as tomaximize her utility, we mean by ‘utility’ simply whateverit is that the agent's behavior suggests her to consistently act so asto make more probable. If this looks circular to you, it should:theorists who follow Samuelson <em>intend</em> the statement‘agents act so as to maximize their utility’ as atautology, where an ‘(economic) agent’ is any entity thatcan be accurately described as acting to maximize a utility function,an ‘action’ is any utility-maximizing selection from a setof possible alternatives, and a‘utility function’ is whatan economic agent maximizes. Like other tautologies occurring in thefoundations of scientific theories, this interlocking (recursive)system of definitions is useful not in itself, but because it helps tofix our contexts of inquiry.</p> <p>Though we might no longer be moved by scruples derived from<em>psychological</em> behaviorism, many theorists continue to followSamuelson's way of understanding utility because they think itimportant that game theory apply to <em>any</em> kind of agent—aperson, a bear, a bee, a firm or a country—and not just to agentswith human minds. When such theorists say that agents act so as tomaximize their utility, they want this to be part of the<em>definition</em> of what it is to be an agent, not an empiricalclaim about possible inner states and motivations. Samuelson'sconception of utility, defined by way of <em>Revealed PreferenceTheory</em> (RPT) introduced in his classic paper (<a href="#Sam38">Samuelson (1938)</a>) satisfies this demand.</p> <p>Economists and others who interpret game theory in terms of revealedpreference theory should not think of game theory as in any way anempirical account of the motivations of some flesh-and-blood actors(such as actual people). Rather, they should regard game theory aspart of the body of mathematics that is used to model those entities(which might or might not literally exist) who consistently selectelements from mutually exclusive action sets as if they were trying tomaximize a utility function. On this interpretation, game theory couldnot be refuted by any empirical observations, since it is not anempirical theory in the first place. Of course, observation andexperience could lead someone favoring this interpretation to concludethat game theory is of little <em>help</em> in describing actual humanbehavior.</p> <p>Some other theorists understand the point of game theorydifferently. They view game theory as providing an explanatory accountof strategic reasoning. For this idea to be applicable, we mustsuppose that agents at least sometimes do what they do innon-parametric settings <em>because</em> game-theoretic logicrecommends certain actions as the ‘rational’ ones. Such anunderstanding of game theory incorporates a <em>normative</em> aspect,since ‘rationality’ is taken to denote a property that anagent should at least generally want to have. These two very generalways of thinking about the possible uses of game theory are compatiblewith the tautological interpretation of utility maximization. Thephilosophical difference is not idle from the perspective of theworking game theorist, however. As we will see in a later section,those who hope to use game theory to explainstrategic <em>reasoning</em>, as opposed to merelystrategic <em>behavior</em>, face some special philosophical andpractical problems.</p> <p>Since game theory involves formal reasoning, we must have a devicefor thinking of utility maximization in mathematical terms. Such adevice is called a <em>utility function</em>. The utility-map for anagent is called a ‘function’ because it maps <em>orderedpreferences</em> onto the real numbers. Suppose that agent <em>x</em>prefers bundle <em>a</em> to bundle <em>b</em> and bundle <em>b</em> tobundle <em>c</em>. We then map these onto a list of numbers, where thefunction maps the highest-ranked bundle onto the largest number in thelist, the second-highest-ranked bundle onto the next-largest number inthe list, and so on, thus:</p> <blockquote> bundle <em>a</em> ≫3 <p>bundle <em>b</em> ≫ 2</p> <p>bundle <em>c</em> ≫ 1</p> </blockquote> <p>The only property mapped by this function is <em>order</em>. Themagnitudes of the numbers are irrelevant; that is, it must not beinferred that <em>x</em> gets 3 times as much utility from bundle<em>a</em> as she gets from bundle <em>c</em>. Thus we could represent<em>exactly the same</em> utility function as that above by </p> <blockquote> bundle <em>a</em> ≫7,326 <p>bundle <em>b</em> ≫ 12.6</p> <p>bundle <em>c</em> ≫−1,000,000</p> </blockquote> <p>The numbers featuring in an ordinal utility function are thus notmeasuring any <em>quantity</em> of anything. A utility-function inwhich magnitudes <em>do</em> matter is called ‘cardinal’.Whenever someone refers to a utility function without specifying whichkind is meant, you should assume that it's ordinal. These are thesorts we'll need for the first set of games we'll examine. Later, whenwe come to seeing how to solve games that involve<em>randomization</em>—our river-crossing game from Part 1above, for example—we'll need to build cardinal utilityfunctions. The technique for doing this was given by <ahref="#neu47"> von Neumann &amp; Morgenstern (1944), and was anessential aspect of their invention of game theory. For the moment,however, we will need only ordinal functions. </ahref="#neu47"></p> <h3><a name="Games">2.2 Games and Information</a></h3> <p>All situations in which at least one agent can only act to maximizehis utility through anticipating (either consciously, or justimplicitly in his behavior) the responses to his actions by one ormore other agents is called a <em>game</em>. Agents involved in gamesare referred to as <em>players</em>. If all agents have optimalactions regardless of what the others do, as in purely parametricsituations or conditions of monopoly or perfect competition (see <a href="#Mot">Section 1</a> above) we can model this without appeal to game theory; otherwise, weneed it.</p> <p>We assume that players have capacities that are collectively referredto in the literature of economics as ‘rationality’. I havedeliberately used this roundabout formulation instead of just saying‘we assume that players are rational’. This reflects mystrong skepticism about the idea that there is one coherent generalbody of norms, which philosophers could discover through analysis,which captures the intricate web of uses of the family of ideas that‘rationality’ has represented in the Western culturaltradition. In any event, the economic rationality presupposed indeciding to apply game theory as a modeling tool is a vastly narrowerand more specific set of restrictions. An economically rational playeris one who can (i) assess outcomes, in the sense of rank-ordering themwith respect to their contributions to her welfare; (ii) calculatepaths to outcomes, in the sense of seeing which sequences of actionswould lead to which outcomes; and (iii) select actions from sets ofalternatives (which we'll describe as ‘choosing’ actions)that yield her most-preferred outcomes, given the actions of the otherplayers. We might summarize the intuition behind all this as follows:an entity is usefully modeled as an economically rational agent to theextent that it has alternatives, and chooses from amongst these in away that is reliably motivated by what seems best for itspurposes. (The philosopher Daniel Dennett would say: we can usefullypredict its behavior from ‘the intentional stance’.)</p> <p>Economic rationality might in some cases be satisfied by internalcomputations performed by an agent, and she might or might not beaware of computing or having computed its conditions andimplications. In other cases, economic rationality might simply beembodied in behavioral dispositions built by natural, cultural ormarket selection. In particular, in calling an action‘chosen’ we imply no necessary deliberation, conscious orotherwise. We mean merely that the action was taken when analternative action was available, in some sense of‘available’ normally established by the context of theparticular analysis. (‘Available’, as used by gametheorists and economists, should never be read as if it meant‘metaphysically’ or ‘logically’ available; itis almost always pragmatic, contextual and endlessly revisable by morerefined modeling.)</p> <p>Each player in a game faces a choice among two or more possible<em>strategies</em>. A strategy is a predetermined ‘programme ofplay’ that tells her what actions to take in response to<em>every possible strategy other players might use</em>. Thesignificance of the italicized phrase here will become clear when wetake up some sample games below.</p> <p>A crucial aspect of the specification of a game involves theinformation that players have when they choose strategies. Thesimplest games (from the perspective of logical structure) are thosein which agents have <em>perfect information</em>, meaning that atevery point where each agent's strategy tells her to take an action,she knows everything that has happened in the game up to that point. Aboard-game of sequential moves in which both players watchall the action (and know the rules in common), such as chess, is aninstance of such a game. By contrast, the example of thebridge-crossing game from Section 1 above illustrates a game of<em>imperfect information</em>, since the fugitive must choose abridge to cross without knowing the bridge at which the pursuer haschosen to wait, and the pursuer similarly makes her decision inignorance of the choices of her quarry. Since game theory is aboutrational action given the strategically significant actions of others,it should not surprise you to be told that what agents in games believe,or fail to believe, about each others' actions makes a considerabledifference to the logic of our analyses, as we will see.</p> <h3><a name="trees">2.3 Trees and Matrices&nbsp;</a></h3> <p>The difference between games of perfect and of imperfect informationis closely related to (though certainly not identical with!) adistinction between <em>ways of representing</em> games that is basedon <em>order of play</em>. Let us begin by distinguishing betweensequential-move and simultaneous-move games in terms ofinformation. It is natural, as a first approximation, to think ofsequential-move games as being ones in which players choose theirstrategies one after the other, and of simultaneous-move games as onesin which players choose their strategies at the same time. This isn'tquite right, however, because what is of strategic importance is notthe temporal <em>order</em> of events per se, but whether and whenplayers <em>know about</em> other players' actions relative to havingto choose their own. For example, if two competing businesses are bothplanning marketing campaigns, one might commit to its strategy monthsbefore the other does; but if neither knows what the other hascommitted to or will commit to when they make their decisions, this isa simultaneous-move game. Chess, by contrast, is normally played as asequential-move game: you see what your opponent has done beforechoosing your own next action. (Chess <em>can</em> be turned into asimultaneous-move game if the players each call moves on a commonboard while isolated from one another; but this is a very differentgame from conventional chess.)</p> <p>It was said above that the distinction between sequential-move andsimultaneous-move games is not identical to the distinction betweenperfect-information and imperfect-information games. Explaining whythis is so is a good way of establishing full understanding of bothsets of concepts. As simultaneous-move games were characterized in theprevious paragraph, it must be true that all simultaneous-move gamesare games of imperfect information. However, some games may containmixes of sequential and simultaneous moves. For example, two firmsmight commit to their marketing strategies independently and insecrecy from one another, but thereafter engage in pricing competitionin full view of one another. If the optimal marketing strategies werepartially or wholly dependent on what was expected to happen in thesubsequent pricing game, then the two stages would need to be analyzedas a single game, in which a stage of sequential play followed a stageof simultaneous play. Whole games that involve mixed stages of thissort are games of imperfect information, however temporally stagedthey might be. Games of perfect information (as the name implies)denote cases where <em>no</em> moves are simultaneous (and where noplayer ever forgets what has gone before).</p> <p>It was said above that games of perfect information are the(logically) simplest sorts of games. This is so because in such games(as long as the games are finite, that is, terminate after a knownnumber of actions) players and analysts can use a straightforwardprocedure for predicting outcomes. A player in such a gamechooses her first action by considering each series of responses andcounter-responses that will result from each action open to her. Shethen asks herself which of the available final outcomes brings her thehighest utility, and chooses the action that starts the chain leadingto this outcome. This process is called <em>backward induction</em>(because the reasoning works backwards from eventual outcomes topresent choice problems).</p> <p>We will have much more to say about backward induction and itsproperties in a later section (when we come to discuss equilibrium andequilibrium selection). For now, we have described it just in order touse it to introduce one of the two types of mathematical objects usedto represent games: <em>game trees</em>. A game tree is an example ofwhat mathematicians call a <em>directed graph</em>. That is, it is aset of connected nodes in which the overall graph has a direction. Wecan draw trees from the top of the page to the bottom, or from left toright. In the first case, nodes at the top of the page are interpretedas coming earlier in the sequence of actions. In the case of a treedrawn from left to right, leftward nodes are prior in the sequence torightward ones. An unlabelled tree has a structure of thefollowing sort:</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure1.gif" width="400" alt="Figure 1" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 1</strong> </blockquote> <p>The point of representing games using trees can best be grasped byvisualizing the use of them in supporting backward-inductionreasoning. Just imagine the player (or analyst) beginning at the endof the tree, where outcomes are displayed, and then working backwardsfrom these, looking for sets of strategies that describe paths leadingto them. Since a player's utility function indicates which outcomesshe prefers to which, we also know which paths she will prefer. Ofcourse, not all paths will be possible because the other player has arole in selecting paths too, and won't take actions that lead to lesspreferred outcomes for him. We will present some examples of thisinteractive path selection, and detailed techniques for reasoningthrough these examples, after we have described a situation we can use a tree tomodel.</p> <p>Trees are used to represent <em>sequential</em> games, because theyshow the order in which actions are taken by the players. However,games are sometimes represented on <em>matrices</em> rather than trees.This is the second type of mathematical object used to represent games.Matrices, unlike trees, simply show the outcomes, represented in termsof the players' utility functions, for every possible combination ofstrategies the players might use. For example, it makes sense todisplay the river-crossing game from <a href="#Mot">Section 1</a> on a matrix, since in that game both the fugitive and the hunter havejust one move each, and each chooses their move in ignorance of whatthe other has decided to do. Here, then, is <em>part of</em> thematrix:</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure2.gif" width="400" alt="figure 2" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 2</strong> </blockquote> <p>The fugitive's three possible strategies—cross at the safebridge, risk the rocks, or risk the cobras—form the rows of thematrix. Similarly, the hunter's three possiblestrategies—waiting at the safe bridge, waiting at the rockybridge and waiting at the cobra bridge—form the columns of thematrix. Each cell of the matrix shows—or, rather <em>would</em>show if our matrix was complete—an <em>outcome</em> defined interms of the players' <em>payoffs</em>. A player's payoff is simplythe number assigned by her ordinal utility function to the state ofaffairs corresponding to the outcome in question. For each outcome,Row's payoff is always listed first, followed by Column's. Thus, forexample, the upper left-hand corner above shows that when the fugitivecrosses at the safe bridge and the hunter is waiting there, thefugitive gets a payoff of 0 and the hunter gets a payoff of 1. Weinterpret these by reference to the two players' utility functions, which in thisgame are very simple. If the fugitive gets safely across the river hereceives a payoff of 1; if he doesn't he gets 0. If the fugitivedoesn't make it, either because he's shot by the hunter or hit by arock or bitten by a cobra, then the hunter gets a payoff of 1 and thefugitive gets a payoff of 0.</p> <p>We'll briefly explain the parts of the matrix that have been filledin, and then say why we can't yet complete the rest. Whenever thehunter waits at the bridge chosen by the fugitive, the fugitive isshot. These outcomes all deliver the payoff vector (0, 1). You can findthem descending diagonally across the matrix above from the upperleft-hand corner. Whenever the fugitive chooses the safe bridge butthe hunter waits at another, the fugitive gets safely across, yieldingthe payoff vector (1, 0). These two outcomes are shown in the secondtwo cells of the top row. All of the other cells are marked, <em>fornow</em>, with question marks. Why? The problem here is that if thefugitive crosses at either the rocky bridge or the cobra bridge, heintroduces parametric factors into the game. In these cases, he takeson some risk of getting killed, and so producing the payoff vector (0,1), that is independent of anything the hunter does. We don't yet haveenough concepts introduced to be able to show how to represent theseoutcomes in terms of utility functions—but by the time we'refinished we will, and this will provide the key to solving our puzzlefrom <a href="#Mot">Section 1</a>.</p> <p>Matrix games are referred to as ‘normal-form’ or‘strategic-form’ games, and games as trees are referred toas ‘extensive-form’ games. The two sorts of games are notequivalent, because extensive-form games containinformation—about sequences of play and players' levels ofinformation about the game structure—that strategic-form gamesdo not. In general, a strategic-form game could represent any one ofseveral extensive-form games, so a strategic-form game is best thoughtof as being a <em>set</em> of extensive-form games. When order of playis irrelevant to a game's outcome, then you should study its strategicform, since it's the whole set you want to know about. Where order ofplay <em>is</em> relevant, the extensive form <em>must</em> bespecified or your conclusions will be unreliable.</p> <h3><a name="PD">2.4 The Prisoner's Dilemma as an Example of Strategic-Form vs. Extensive-Form Representation</a></h3> <p>The distinctions described above are difficult to fully grasp if allone has to go on are abstract descriptions. They're best illustrated bymeans of an example. For this purpose, we'll use the most famous game:the Prisoner's Dilemma. It in fact gives the logic of the problem facedby Cortez's and Henry V's soldiers (see <a href="#Mot">Section 1 above</a>), and by Hobbes's agents before they empower the tyrant. However, forreasons which will become clear a bit later, you should not take thePD as a <em>typical</em> game; it isn't. We use it as an extendedexample here only because it's particularly helpful for illustratingthe <em>relationship</em> between strategic-form and extensive-formgames (and later, for illustrating the relationships between one-shotand repeated games; see <a href="#Repeat">Section 4</a> below). </p> <p>The name of the Prisoner's Dilemma game is derived from the followingsituation typically used to exemplify it. Suppose that the police havearrested two people whom they know have committed an armed robberytogether. Unfortunately, they lack enough admissible evidence to get ajury to convict. They <em>do</em>, however, have enough evidence tosend each prisoner away for two years for theft of the getawaycar. The chief inspector now makes the following offer to eachprisoner: If you will confess to the robbery, implicating yourpartner, and she does not also confess, then you'll go free and she'llget ten years. If you both confess, you'll each get 5 years. Ifneither of you confess, then you'll each get two years for the autotheft.</p> <p>Our first step in modeling the two prisoners' situation as a game isto represent it in terms of utility functions. Following the usualconvention, let us name the prisoners ‘Player I’ and‘Player II’. Both Player I's and Player II's utilityfunctions are identical:</p> <blockquote> Go free ≫ 4 <p>2 years ≫ 3</p> <p>5 years ≫ 2</p> <p>10 years ≫ 0</p> </blockquote> <p>The numbers in the function above are now used to express eachplayer's <em>payoffs</em> in the various outcomes possible in thesituation. We can represent the problem faced by both of them on asingle matrix that captures the way in which their separate choicesinteract; this is the strategic form of their game:</p> <!--pdf include<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>pdf include--> <blockquote> <img src="figure3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 3</strong> </blockquote> <p>Each cell of the matrix gives the payoffs to both players for eachcombination of actions. Player I's payoff appears as the first numberof each pair, Player II's as the second. So, if both players confessthen they each get a payoff of 2 (5 years in prison each). Thisappears in the upper-left cell. If neither of them confess, they eachget a payoff of 3 (2 years in prison each). This appears as thelower-right cell. If Player I confesses and Player II doesn't thenPlayer I gets a payoff of 4 (going free) and Player II gets a payoffof 0 (ten years in prison). This appears in the upper-right cell. Thereverse situation, in which Player II confesses and Player I refuses,appears in the lower-left cell.</p> <p>Each player evaluates his or her two possible actions here bycomparing their personal payoffs in each column, since this shows youwhich of their actions is preferable, just to themselves, for eachpossible action by their partner. So, observe: If Player II confessesthen Player I gets a payoff of 2 by confessing and a payoff of 0 byrefusing. If Player II refuses, then Player I gets a payoff of 4 byconfessing and a payoff of 3 by refusing. Therefore, Player I isbetter off confessing regardless of what Player II does. Player II,meanwhile, evaluates her actions by comparing her payoffs down eachrow, and she comes to exactly the same conclusion that Player Idoes. Wherever one action for a player is superior to her otheractions for each possible action by the opponent, we say that thefirst action<em>strictly dominates</em> the second one. In the PD, then,confessing strictly dominates refusing for both players. Both playersknow this about each other, thus entirely eliminating any temptationto depart from the strictly dominated path. Thus both players willconfess, and both will go to prison for 5 years.</p> <p>The players, and analysts, can predict this outcome using a mechanicalprocedure, known as iterated elimination of strictly dominatedstrategies. Player 1 can see by examining the matrix thathis payoffs in each cell of the top row are higher than his payoffsin each corresponding cell of the bottom row. Therefore, it can neverbe utility-maximizing for him to play his bottom-row strategy, viz., refusingto confess, <em>regardless of what Player II does</em>. SincePlayer I's bottom-row strategy will never be played, we can simply<em>delete</em> the bottom row from the matrix. Now it is obvious thatPlayer II will not refuse to confess, since her payoff from confessingin the two cells that remain is higher than her payoff from refusing.So, once again, we can delete the one-cell column on the right fromthe game. We now have only one cell remaining, that corresponding tothe outcome brought about by mutual confession. Since the reasoningthat led us to delete all other possible outcomes depended at eachstep only on the premise that both players are economically rational— that is, will choose strategies that lead to higher payoffsover strategies that lead to lower ones — there is very stronggrounds for viewing joint confession as the<em>solution</em> to the game, the outcome on which its play<em>must</em> converge to the extent that economic rationalitycorrectly models the motivations of the players. You should note thatthe order in which strictly dominated rows and columns are deleteddoesn't matter. Had we begun by deleting the right-hand column andthen deleted the bottom row, we would have arrived at the samesolution.</p> <p>It's been said a couple of times that the PD is not a typical game inmany respects. One of these respects is that all its rows and columnsare either strictly dominated or strictly dominant. In anystrategic-form game where this is true, iterated elimination ofstrictly dominated strategies is guaranteed to yield a uniquesolution. Later, however, we will see that for many games thiscondition does not apply, and then our analytic task is lessstraightforward.</p> <p>The reader will probably have noticed something disturbing about the outcomeof the PD. Had both players refused to confess, they'd have arrived at thelower-right outcome in which they each go to prison for only 2 years,thereby <em>both</em> earning higher utility than either receives when bothconfess. This is the most important fact about the PD, and itssignificance for game theory is quite general. We'll therefore returnto it below when we discuss equilibrium concepts in game theory. Fornow, however, let us stay with our use of this particular game toillustrate the difference between strategic and extensive forms.</p> <p>When people introduce the PD into popular discussions, one willoften hear them say that the police inspector must lock hisprisoners into separate rooms so that they can't communicate with oneanother. The reasoning behind this idea seems obvious: if the players couldcommunicate, they'd surely see that they're each better off if both refuse,and could make an agreement to do so, no? This, one presumes, wouldremove each player's conviction that he or she must confess because they'll otherwisebe sold up the river by their partner. In fact, however, this intuitionis misleading and its conclusion is false.</p> <p>When we represent the PD as a strategic-form game, we implicitlyassume that the prisoners can't attempt collusive agreement since theychoose their actions simultaneously. In this case, agreement beforethe fact can't help. If Player I is convinced that his partner will stickto the bargain then he can seize the opportunity to go scot-free byconfessing. Of course, he realizes that the same temptation will occurto Player II; but in that case he again wants to make sure he confesses, asthis is his only means of avoiding his worst outcome. The prisoners' agreementcomes to naught because they have no way of enforcing it; their promises to each otherconstitute what game theorists call ‘cheap talk’.</p> <p>But now suppose that the prisoners do <em>not</em> movesimultaneously. That is, suppose that Player II canchoose <em>after</em> observing Player I's action. This is the sort ofsituation that people who think non-communication important must havein mind. Now Player II will be able to see that Player I has remainedsteadfast when it comes to her choice, and she need not be concernedabout being suckered. However, this doesn't change anything, a pointthat is best made by re-representing the game in extensive form. Thisgives us our opportunity to introduce game-trees and the method ofanalysis appropriate to them.</p> <p>First, however, here are definitions of some concepts that will behelpful in analyzing game-trees:</p> <blockquote> <em>Node</em>: A point at which a player chooses an action. <p><em>Initial node</em>: The point at which the first action in thegame occurs.</p> <p><em>Terminal node</em>: Any node which, if reached, ends the game.Each terminal node corresponds to an <em>outcome</em>.</p> <p><em>Subgame</em>: Any connected set of nodes and branches descending uniquelyfrom one node.</p> <p><em>Payoff</em>: an ordinal utility number assigned to a player atan outcome.</p> <p><em>Outcome</em>: an assignment of a set of payoffs, one to eachplayer in the game.</p> <p><em>Strategy</em>: a program instructing a player which action totake at every node in the tree where she could possibly be called on tomake a choice.</p> </blockquote> <p>These quick definitions may not mean very much to you until you followthem being put to use in our analyses of trees below. It will probablybe best if you scroll back and forth between them and the examples aswe work through them. By the time you understand each example, you'llfind the concepts and their definitions quite natural and intuitive. </p> <p>To make this exercise maximally instructive, let's suppose thatPlayers I and II have studied the matrix above and, seeing thatthey're both better off in the outcome represented by the lower-rightcell, have formed an agreement to cooperate. Player I is to commit torefusal first, after which Player II will reciprocate when the policeask for her choice. We will refer to a strategy of keeping theagreement as ‘cooperation’, and will denote it in the treebelow with ‘C’. We will refer to a strategy of breakingthe agreement as ‘defection’, and will denote it on thetree below with ‘D’. Each node is numbered 1, 2, 3,… , from top to bottom, for ease of reference indiscussion. Here, then, is the tree:</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure4.gif" alt="Figure 4" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 4</strong> </blockquote> <p>Look first at each of the terminal nodes (those along the bottom).These represent possible outcomes. Each is identified with anassignment of payoffs, just as in the strategic-form game, with Player I'spayoff appearing first in each set and Player II's appearing second. Each ofthe structures descending from the nodes 1, 2 and 3 respectively is asubgame. We begin our backward-induction analysis—using atechnique called <em>Zermelo's algorithm</em>—with the sub-gamesthat arise last in the sequence of play. If the subgame descendingfrom node 3 is played, then Player II will face a choice between apayoff of 4 and a payoff of 3. (Consult the second number,representing her payoff, in each set at a terminal node descendingfrom node 3.) II earns her higher payoff by playing D. We maytherefore replace the entire subgame with an assignment of the payoff(0,4) directly to node 3, since this is the outcome that will berealized if the game reaches that node. Now consider the subgamedescending from node 2. Here, II faces a choice between a payoff of 2and one of 0. She obtains her higher payoff, 2, by playing D. We maytherefore assign the payoff (2,2) directly to node 2. Now we move tothe subgame descending from node 1. (This subgame is, of course,identical to the whole game; all games are subgames of themselves.)Player I now faces a choice between outcomes (2,2) and(0,4). Consulting the first numbers in each of these sets, he seesthat he gets his higher payoff—2—by playing D. D is, ofcourse, the option of confessing. So Player I confesses, and then Player IIalso confesses, yielding the same outcome as in thestrategic-form representation.</p> <p>What has happened here intuitively is that Player I realizes that if he plays C(refuse to confess) at node 1, then Player II will be able tomaximize her utility by suckering him and playing D. (On the tree, thishappens at node 3.) This leaves Player I with a payoff of 0 (ten years inprison), which he can avoid only by playing D to begin with. Hetherefore defects from the agreement.</p> <p>We have thus seen that in the case of the Prisoner's Dilemma, thesimultaneous and sequential versions yield the same outcome. This willoften not be true of other games, however. Furthermore, only finite extensive-form(sequential) games of perfect information — can be solved usingZermelo's algorithm.</p> <p>As noted earlier in this section, sometimes we must representsimultaneous moves <em>within</em> games that are otherwise sequential.(In all such cases the game as a whole will be one ofimperfect information, so we won't be able to solve it using Zermelo'salgorithm.) We represent such games using the device of <em>informationsets</em>. Consider the following tree:</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure5.gif" alt="Figure 5" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 5</strong> </blockquote> <p>The oval drawn around nodes <em>b</em> and <em>c</em> indicates thatthey lie within a common information set. This means that at thesenodes players cannot infer back up the path from whence they came; Player IIdoes not know, in choosing her strategy, whether she is at <em>b</em>or <em>c</em>. (For this reason, what properly bear numbers inextensive-form games are information sets, conceived as ‘actionpoints’, rather than nodes themselves; this is why the nodesinside the oval are labelled with letters rather than numbers.) Putanother way, Player II, when choosing, does not know what Player I has done at node<em>a</em>. But you will recall from earlier in this section that thisis just what defines two moves as simultaneous. We can thus see thatthe method of representing games as trees is entirely general. If nonode after the initial node is alone in an information set on itstree, so that the game has only one subgame (itself), then the wholegame is one of simultaneous play. If at least one node shares itsinformation set with another, while others are alone, the gameinvolves both simultaneous and sequential play, and so is still a gameof imperfect information. Only if all information sets are inhabitedby just one node do we have a game of perfect information.</p> <h3><a name="SolConEqu">2.5 Solution Concepts and Equilibria</a></h3> <p>In the Prisoner's Dilemma, the outcome we've represented as (2,2),indicating mutual defection, was said to be the ‘solution’to the game. Following the general practice in economics, gametheorists refer to the solutions of games as <em>equilibria.</em>Philosophically minded readers will want to pose a conceptual questionright here: What is ‘equilibrated’ about some gameoutcomes such that we are motivated to call them‘solutions’? When we say that a physical system is inequilibrium, we mean that it is in a <em>stable</em> state, one inwhich all the causal forces internal to the system balance each otherout and so leave it ‘at rest’ until and unless it isperturbed by the intervention of some exogenous (that is,‘external’) force. This is what economists havetraditionally meant in talking about ‘equilibria’; theyread economic systems as being networks of mutually constraining(often causal) relations, just like physical systems, and theequilibria of such systems are then their endogenously stablestates. As we will see in later sections, it is possible to maintainthis understanding of equilibria in the case of game theory. However,as we noted in Section 2.1, some people interpret game theory as beingan explanatory theory of strategic reasoning. For them, a solution toa game must be an outcome that a rational agent wouldpredict <em>using the mechanisms of rational computationalone</em>. Such theorists face some puzzles about solution conceptsthat are less important to the theorist who isn't trying to use gametheory to under-write a general analysis of rationality. The interestof philosophers in game theory is more often motivated by thisambition than is that of the economist or other scientist. </p> <p>It's useful to start the discussion here from the case of thePrisoner's Dilemma because it's unusually simple from the perspectiveof the puzzles about solution concepts. What we referred to as its‘solution’ is the unique <em>Nash equilibrium</em> of thegame. (The ‘Nash’ here refers to John Nash, the NobelLaureate mathematician who in <a href="#Nas50a">Nash (1950)</a> did most to extend and generalize von Neumann &amp; Morgenstern'spioneering work.) Nash equilibrium (henceforth ‘NE’)applies (or fails to apply, as the case may be) to whole <em>sets</em>of strategies, one for each player in a game. A set of strategies is aNE just in case no player could improve her payoff, given thestrategies of all other players in the game, by changing herstrategy. Notice how closely this idea is related to the idea ofstrict dominance: no strategy could be a NE strategy if it is strictlydominated. Therefore, if iterative elimination of strictly dominatedstrategies takes us to a unique outcome, we know that the vector ofstrategies that leads to it is the game's unique NE. Now, almost alltheorists agree that avoidance of strictly dominated strategies isa <em>minimum</em> requirement of economic rationality. A player whoknowingly chooses a strictly dominated strategy directly violatesclause (iii) of the definition of economic agency as givenin <a href="#games">Section 2.2</a>. This implies that <em>if</em> agame has an outcome that is a unique NE, as in the case of jointconfession in the PD, that must be its unique solution. This is one ofthe most important respects in which the PD is an ‘easy’(and atypical) game.</p> <p>We can specify one class of games in which NE is always not onlynecessary but <em>sufficient</em> as a solution concept. These arefinite perfect-information games that are also <em>zero-sum</em>. Azero-sum game (in the case of a game involving just two players) isone in which one player can only be made better off by making theother player worse off. (Tic-tac-toe is a simple example of such agame: any move that brings me closer to winning brings you closer tolosing, and vice-versa.) We can determine whether a game is zero-sumby examining players' utility functions: in zero-sum games these willbe mirror-images of each other, with one player's highly rankedoutcomes being low-ranked for the other and vice-versa. In such agame, if I am playing a strategy such that, given your strategy, Ican't do any better, and if you are <em>also</em> playing such astrategy, then, since any change of strategy by me would have to makeyou worse off and vice-versa, it follows that our game can have nosolution compatible with our mutual rationality other than its uniqueNE. We can put this another way: in a zero-sum game, my playing astrategy that maximizes my minimum payoff if you play the best youcan, and your simultaneously doing the same thing, is just<em>equivalent</em> to our both playing our best strategies, so thispair of so-called ‘maximin’ procedures is guaranteed tofind the unique solution to the game, which is its unique NE. (Intic-tac-toe, this is a draw. You can't do any better than drawing, andneither can I, if both of us are trying to win and trying not tolose.)</p> <p>However, most games do not have this property. It won't be possible,in this one article, to enumerate <em>all</em> of the ways in whichgames can be problematic from the perspective of their possiblesolutions. (For one thing, it is highly unlikely that theorists haveyet discovered all of the possible problems.) However, we can try togeneralize the issues a bit.</p> <p>First, there is the problem that in most non-zero-sum games, thereis more than one NE, but not all NE look equally plausible as thesolutions upon which strategically rational players would hit. Considerthe strategic-form game below (taken from <a href="#Kre90">Kreps (1990)</a>, p. 403):</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure6.jpg" alt="Figure 6" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 6</strong> </blockquote> <p>This game has two NE: s1-t1 and s2-t2. (Note that no rows or columnsare strictly dominated here. But if Player I is playing s1 then PlayerII can do no better than t1, and vice-versa; and similarly for thes2-t2 pair.) If NE is our only solution concept, then we shall beforced to say that either of these outcomes is equally persuasive as asolution. However, if game theory is regarded as an explanatory and/ornormative theory of strategic reasoning, this seems to be leavingsomething out: surely rational players with perfect information wouldconverge on s1-t1? (Note that this is <em>not</em> like the situationin the PD, where the socially superior situation is unachievablebecause it is not a NE. In the case of the game above, both playershave every reason to try to converge on the NE in which they arebetter off.)</p> <p>This illustrates the fact that NE is a relatively (logically)<em>weak</em> solution concept, often failing to predict intuitivelysensible solutions because, if applied alone, it refuses to allowplayers to use principles of equilibrium selection that, if not<em>demanded</em> by economic rationality, at least seem both sensibleand computationally accessible. Consider another example from <a href="#Kre90">Kreps (1990)</a>, p. 397:</p> <!--pdf include<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>pdf include--> <blockquote> <img src="figure7.jpg" alt="Figure 7" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 7</strong> </blockquote> <p>Here, no strategy strictly dominates another. However, Player I's toprow, s1, <em>weakly</em> dominates s2, since I does <em>at least aswell</em> using s1 as s2 for any reply by Player II, and on one replyby II (t2), I does better. So should not the players (and the analyst)delete the weakly dominated row s2? When they do so, column t1 is thenstrictly dominated, and the NE s1-t2 is selected as the uniquesolution. However, as Kreps goes on to show using this example, theidea that weakly dominated strategies should be deleted just likestrict ones has odd consequences. <a name="11">Suppose</a> we change the payoffs of the game just a bit, as follows:</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure8.jpg" alt="Figure 8" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 8</strong> </blockquote> <p>s2 is still weakly dominated as before; but of our two NE, s2-t1 isnow the most attractive for both players; so why should the analysteliminate its possibility? (Note that this game, again, does<em>not</em> replicate the logic of the PD. There, it makes sense toeliminate the most attractive outcome, joint refusal to confess,because both players have incentives to unilaterally deviate from it,so it is not an NE. This is not true of s2-t1 in the present game. Youshould be starting to clearly see why we called the PD game‘atypical’.) The argument <em>for</em> eliminating weaklydominated strategies is that Player 1 may be nervous, fearing thatPlayer II is not completely <em>sure</em> to be rational (or thatPlayer II fears that Player I isn't completely rational, or thatPlayer II fears that Player I fears that Player II isn't completelyrational, and so on ad infinitum) and so might play t2 with somepositive probability. If the possibility of departures fromrationality is taken seriously, then we have an argument foreliminating weakly dominated strategies: Player I thereby insuresherself against her worst outcome, s2-t2. Of course, she pays a costfor this insurance, reducing her expected payoff from 10 to 5. On theother hand, we might imagine that the players could communicate beforeplaying the game and agree to play <em>correlated strategies</em> so asto <em>coordinate</em> on s2-t1, thereby removing some, most or all ofthe uncertainty that encourages elimination of the weakly dominatedrow s1, and eliminating s1-t2 as a viable solution instead!&nbsp;</p> <p>Any proposed principle for solving games that may have the effect ofeliminating one or more NE from consideration as solutions is referred to as a<em>refinement</em> of NE. In the case just discussed, elimination ofweakly dominated strategies is one possible refinement, since itrefines away the NE s2-t1, and correlation is another, since itrefines away the other NE, s1-t2, instead. So which refinement is moreappropriate as a solution concept? People who think of game theory asan explanatory and/or normative theory of strategic rationality havegenerated a substantial literature in which the merits and drawbacksof a large number of refinements are debated. In principle, thereseems to be no limit on the number of refinements that could beconsidered, since there may also be no limits on the set ofphilosophical intuitions about what principles a rational agent mightor might not see fit to follow or to fear or hope that other playersare following.</p> <p>We now digress briefly to make a point about terminology. In previouseditions of the present article, we referred to theorists who adoptthe revealed preference interpretation of the utility functions ingame theory as ‘behaviorists’. This reflected the fact therevealed preference approaches equate choices with economicallyconsistent actions, rather than intending to refer to mentalconstructs. However, this usage is likely to cause confusion due tothe recent rise of <em>behavioral game theory</em>(<a href="#Cam03">Camerer 2003)</a>. This program of research aims todirectly incorporate into game-theoretic models generalizations,derived mainly from experiments with people, about ways in whichpeople differ from economic agents in the inferences they draw frominformation (‘framing’). Applications also typicallyincorporate special assumptions about utility functions, also derivedfrom experiments. For example, players may be taken to be willing tomake trade-offs between the magnitudes of their own payoffs andinequalities in the distribution of payoffs among the players. We willturn to some discussion of behavioral game theoryin <a href="#lab">Section 7.1</a>, <a href="#neuro">Section 7.2</a>and <a href="#human">Section 7.3</a>. For the moment, note that thisuse of game theory crucially rests on assumptions about psychologicalrepresentations of value thought to be common among people. Thus itwould be misleading to refer to behavioral game theory as‘behaviorist’. But then it just would invite confusion tocontinue referring to conventional economic game theory that relies onrevealed preference as ‘behaviorist’ game theory. We willtherefore switch to calling it ‘non-psychological’ gametheory. We mean by this the kind of game theory used by mosteconomists who are not behavioral economists. They treat game theoryas the abstract mathematics of strategic interaction, rather than asan attempt to directly characterize special psychological dispositionsthat might be typical in humans.</p> <p>Non-psychological game theorists tend to take a dim view of much ofthe refinement program. This is for the obvious reason that it relieson intuitions about inferences that people <em>should</em> findsensible. Like most scientists, non-psychological game theorists aresuspicious of the force and basis of philosophical assumptions asguides to empirical modeling.</p> <p>Behavioral game theory, by contrast, can be understood as a refinementof game theory, though not necessarily its solution concepts, in adifferent sense. It restricts the theory's underlying axioms forapplication to a special class of agents, individual, psychologicallytypical humans. It motivates this restriction by reference toinferences, along with preferences, that people <em>do</em>find <em>natural</em>, regardless of whether theseseem <em>rational</em>, which they frequently donot. Non-psychological and behavioral game theory have in common thatneither is intended to be normative — though both are often used totry to <em>describe</em> norms that prevail in groups of players, aswell to <em>explain</em> why norms might persist in groups of playerseven when they appear to be less than fully rational to philosophicalintuitions. Both see the job of <em>applied</em> game theory as beingto predict outcomes of empirical games <em>given</em> somedistribution of strategic dispositions, and some distribution ofexpectations about the strategic dispositions of others, that areshaped by dynamics in players' environments, including institutionalpressures and structures and evolutionary selection. Let us thereforegroup non-psychological and behavioral game theorists together, justfor purposes of contrast with normative game theorists,as <em>descriptive</em> game theorists.</p> <p>Descriptive game theorists are often inclined to doubt that the goalof seeking a<em>general</em> theory of rationality makes sense as aproject. Institutions and evolutionary processes build manyenvironments, and what counts as rational procedure in one environmentmay not be favoured in another. On the other hand, an entity that isnot rational in the minimal sense of economic rationality cannot,except by accident, be accurately characterized as aiming to maximizea utility function. To such entities game theory has no application inthe first place. </p> <p>This does not imply that non-psychological game theorists abjure allprincipled ways of restricting sets of NE to subsets based on theirrelative probabilities of arising. In particular, non-psychologicalgame theorists tend to be sympathetic to approaches that shiftemphasis from rationality itself onto considerations of theinformational dynamics of games. We should perhaps not be surprisedthat NE analysis alone often fails to tell us much of applied,empirical interest about strategic-form games (e.g., Figure 6 above),in which informational structure is suppressed. Equilibrium selectionissues are often more fruitfully addressed in the context ofextensive-form games.</p> <h3><a name="Subgame">2.6 Subgame Perfection</a></h3> <p>In order to deepen our understanding of extensive-form games, we needan example with more interesting structure than the PD offers. </p> <p>Consider the game described by this tree:</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure9.gif" alt="Figure 9" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 9</strong> </blockquote> <p>This game is not intended to fit any preconceived situation; it issimply a mathematical object in search of an application. (L and R herejust denote ‘left’ and ‘right’ respectively.) </p> <p>Now consider the strategic form of this game:</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure10.gif" alt="Figure 10" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 10</strong> </blockquote> <p>If you are confused by this, remember that a strategy must tell aplayer what to do at <em>every</em> information set where that playerhas an action. Since each player chooses between two actions at eachof two information sets here, each player has four strategies intotal. The first letter in each strategy designation tells eachplayer what to do if he or she reaches their first information set,the second what to do if their second information set isreached. I.e., LR for Player II tells II to play L if information set5 is reached and R if information set 6 is reached. </p> <p>If you examine the matrix in Figure 10, you will discover that (LL,RL) is among the NE. This is a bit puzzling, since if Player I reachesher second information set (7) in the extensive-form game, she wouldhardly wish to play L there; she earns a higher payoff by playing R atnode 7. Mere NE analysis doesn't notice this because NE is insensitiveto what happens <em>off the path of play</em>. Player I, in choosing Lat node 4, ensures that node 7 will not be reached; this is what ismeant by saying that it is ‘off the path of play’. Inanalyzing extensive-form games, however, we <em>should</em> care whathappens off the path of play, because consideration of this is crucialto what happens<em>on</em> the path. For example, it is the fact that Player I<em>would</em> play R if node 7 were reached that <em>would</em> causePlayer II to play L if node 6 were reached, and this is why Player Iwon't choose R at node 4. We are throwing away information relevant togame solutions if we ignore off-path outcomes, as mere NE analysisdoes. Notice that this reason for doubting that NE is a whollysatisfactory equilibrium concept in itself has nothing to do withintuitions about rationality, as in the case of the refinementconcepts discussed in Section 2.5.</p> <p>Now apply Zermelo's algorithm to the extensive form of our currentexample. Begin, again, with the last subgame, that descending from node7. This is Player I's move, and she would choose R because she prefersher payoff of 5 to the payoff of 4 she gets by playing L. Therefore, weassign the payoff (5, −1) to node 7. Thus at node 6 II faces a choicebetween (−1, 0) and (5, −1). He chooses L. At node 5 II chooses R. Atnode 4 I is thus choosing between (0, 5) and (−1, 0), and so plays L.Note that, as in the PD, an outcome appears at a terminal node—(4,5) from node 7—that is Pareto superior to the NE. Again, however,the dynamics of the game prevent it from being reached.</p> <p>The fact that Zermelo's algorithm picks out the strategy vector (LR,RL) as the unique solution to the game shows that it's yieldingsomething other than just an NE. In fact, it is generating the game's<em>subgame perfect equilibrium</em> (SPE). It gives an outcome thatyields a NE not just in the <em>whole</em> game but in every subgameas well. This is a persuasive solution concept because, again unlikethe refinements of Section 2.5, it does not demand ‘extra’rationality of agents in the sense of expecting them to have and usephilosophical intuitions about ‘what makes sense’. Itdoes, however, assume that players not only know everythingstrategically relevant to their situation but also <em>use</em> all ofthat information. In arguments about the foundations of economics,this is often referred to as an aspect of rationality (as in thephrase ‘rational expectations’. It is helpful to becareful not to confuse rationality in general with computational powerand the possession of budgets, in time and energy, to make the most ofit.</p> <p>An agent playing a subgame perfect strategy simply chooses, at everynode she reaches, the path that brings her the highest payoff <em>inthe subgame emanating from that node</em>. SPE predicts a game'soutcome just in case, in solving the game, the players foresee thatthey will all do that.</p> <p>A main value of analyzing extensive-form games for SPE is that thiscan help us to locate structural barriers to social optimization. Inour current example, Player I would be better off, and Player II noworse off, at the left-hand node emanating from node 7 than at the SPEoutcome. But Player I's basic economic rationality, and Player II'sawareness of this, blocks the socially efficient outcome. If ourplayers wish to bring about the more socially efficient outcome (4,5)here, they must do so by redesigning their institutions so as tochange the structure of the game. The enterprise of changinginstitutional and informational structures so as to make efficientoutcomes more likely in the games that agents (that is, people,corporations, governments, etc.) actually play is knownas <em>mechanism design</em>, and is one of the leading areas ofapplication of game theory. The main techniques are reviewedin <a href="#Hur06">Hurwicz and Reiter (2006)</a>, the first author ofwhich was awarded the Nobel Prize for his pioneering work in thearea.</p> <h3><a name="IP">2.7 On Interpreting Payoffs: Morality and Efficiency in Games</a></h3> <p>Many readers, but especially philosophers, might wonder why, in thecase of the example taken up in the previous section, mechanism designshould be necessary unless players are morbidly selfishsociopaths. Surely, the players might be able to just <em>see</em>that outcome (4,5) is socially and morally superior; and since thewhole problem also takes for granted that they can also see the pathof actions that leads to this efficient outcome, who is the gametheorist to announce that, unless their game is changed, it'sunattainable? This objection, which applies the distinctive idea ofrationality urged by Immanuel Kant, indicates the leading way in whichmany philosophers mean more by ‘rationality’ thandescriptive game theorists do. This theme is explored with greatliveliness and polemical force in Binmore (<a href="#Bin94">1994</a>, <a href="#Bin98">1998</a>).</p> <p>This weighty philosophical controversy about rationality is sometimesconfused by misinterpretation of the meaning of ‘utility’in non-psychological game theory. To root out this mistake, considerthe Prisoner's Dilemma again. We have seen that in the unique NE ofthe PD, both players get less utility than they could have throughmutual cooperation. This may strike you, even if you are not a Kantian(as it has struck many commentators) as perverse. Surely, you maythink, it simply results from a combination of selfishness andparanoia on the part of the players. To begin with they have no regardfor the social good, and then they shoot themselves in the feet bybeing too untrustworthy to respect agreements.</p> <p>This way of thinking is very common in popular discussions, and badlymixed up. To dispel its influence, let us first introduce someterminology for talking about outcomes. Welfare economists typicallymeasure social good in terms of <em>Pareto efficiency</em>. Adistribution of utility β is said to be <em>Pareto superior</em>over another distribution δ just in case from state δthere is a possible redistribution of utility to β such that atleast one player is better off in β than in δ and no playeris worse off. Failure to move from a Pareto-inferior to aPareto-superior distribution is<em>inefficient</em> because the existence of β as a possibility,at least in principle, shows that in δ some utility is beingwasted. Now, the outcome (3,3) that represents mutual cooperation inour model of the PD is clearly Pareto superior over mutual defection;at (3,3)<em>both</em> players are better off than at (2,2). So it is true thatPDs lead to inefficient outcomes. This was true of our example inSection 2.6 as well.</p> <p>However, inefficiency should not be associated with immorality. Autility function for a player is supposed to represent <em>everythingthat player cares about</em>, which may be anything at all. As we havedescribed the situation of our prisoners they do indeed care only abouttheir own relative prison sentences, but there is nothing essential inthis. What makes a game an instance of the PD is strictly and only itspayoff structure. Thus we could have two Mother Theresa types here,both of whom care little for themselves and wish only to feed starvingchildren. But suppose the original Mother Theresa wishes to feed thechildren of Calcutta while Mother Juanita wishes to feed the childrenof Bogota. And suppose that the international aid agency will maximizeits donation if the two saints nominate the same city, will give thesecond-highest amount if they nominate each others' cities, and thelowest amount if they each nominate their own city. Our saints are in aPD here, though hardly selfish or unconcerned with the social good.</p> <p>To return to our prisoners, suppose that, contrary to our assumptions,they <em>do</em> value each other's well-being as well as theirown. In that case, this must be reflected in their utility functions,and hence in their payoffs. If their payoff structures are changed sothat, for example, they would feel so badly about contributing toinefficiency that they'd rather spend extra years in prison thanendure the shame, then they will no longer be in a PD. But all thisshows is that not every possible situation is a PD; itdoes <em>not</em> show that selfishness is among the assumptions ofgame theory. It is the <em>logic</em> of the prisoners' situation, nottheir psychology, that traps them in the inefficient outcome, and ifthat really <em>is</em> their situation then they are stuck in it(barring further complications to be discussed below). Agents who wishto avoid inefficient outcomes are best advised to prevent certaingames from arising; the defender of the possibility of Kantianrationality is really proposing that they try to dig themselves out ofsuch games by turning themselves into different kinds of agents.</p> <p>In general, then, a game is partly <em>defined</em> by the payoffsassigned to the players. In any application, such assignments shouldbe based on sound empirical evidence. If a proposed solution involvestacitly changing these payoffs, then this ‘solution’ is infact a disguised way of changing the subject and evading theimplications of best modeling practice.</p> <h3><a name="trembling">2.8 Trembling Hands</a></h3> <p>Our last point above opens the way to a philosophical puzzle, one ofseveral that still preoccupy those concerned with the logicalfoundations of game theory. It can be raised with respect to any numberof examples, but we will borrow an elegant one from C. Bicchieri (<a href="#Bic93">1993</a>). Consider thefollowing game: </p> <blockquote> <img src="figure11.gif" alt="Figure 11" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 11</strong> </blockquote> <p>The NE outcome here is at the single leftmost node descending fromnode 8. To see this, backward induct again. At node 10, I would play Lfor a payoff of 3, giving II a payoff of 1. II can do better than thisby playing L at node 9, giving I a payoff of 0. I can do better thanthis by playing L at node 8; so that is what I does, and the gameterminates without II getting to move. A puzzle is then raised byBicchieri (along with other authors,including <a href="#Bin87">Binmore (1987)</a>and <a href="#Pet89">Pettit and Sugden (1989)</a>) by way of thefollowing reasoning. Player I plays L at node 8 because she knows thatPlayer II is economically rational, and so would, at node 9, play Lbecause Player II knows that Player I is economically rational and sowould, at node 10, play L. But now we have the following paradox:Player I must suppose that Player II, at node 9, would predict PlayerI's economically rational play at node 10 despite having arrived at anode (9) that could only be reached if Player I is not economicallyrational! If Player I is not economically rational then Player II isnot justified in predicting that Player I will not play R at node 10,in which case it is not clear that Player II shouldn't play R at 9;and if Player II plays R at 9, then Player I is guaranteed of a betterpayoff then she gets if she plays L at node 8. Both players usebackward induction to solve the game; backward induction requires thatPlayer I know that Player II knows that Player I is economicallyrational; but Player II can solve the game only by using a backwardinduction argument that takes as a premise the economic irrationalityof Player I. This is the <em>paradox of backward induction</em>.</p> <p>A standard way around this paradox in the literature is to invokethe so-called ‘trembling hand’ due to <a href="#Sel75">Selten (1975)</a>. The idea here is that a decision and its consequent act may‘come apart’ with some nonzero probability, howeversmall. That is, a player might intend to take an action but then slipup in the execution and send the game down some other path instead. Ifthere is even a remote possibility that a player may make amistake—that her ‘hand may tremble’—then nocontradiction is introduced by a player's using a backward inductionargument that requires the hypothetical assumption that another playerhas taken a path that an economically rational player could not choose. In ourexample, Player II could reason about what to do at node 9 conditional on theassumption that Player I chose L at node 8 but then slipped.</p> <p><a href="#Gin09">Gintis (2009)</a> points out that the apparentparadox does not arise merely from our supposing that both players areeconomically rational. It rests crucially on the additional premisethat each player must know, and reasons on the basis of knowing, thatthe other player is economically rational. This is the premise withwhich each player's conjectures about what would happen off theequilibrium path of play are inconsistent. A player has reason toconsider out-of-equilibrium possibilities if she either believes thather opponent is rational but his hand may tremble <em>or</em> sheattaches some nonzero probability to the possibility that he is noteconomically rational <em>or</em> she attaches some doubt to herconjecture about his utility function. As Gintis also stresses, thisissue with solving extensive-form games games for SEP by Zermelo'salgorithm generalizes: a player has no reason to play evena <em>Nash</em> equilibrium strategy unless she expects other playersto also play Nash equilibrium strategies. We will return to this issuein <a href="#Evo">Section 6</a> below.</p> <p>The paradox of backward induction, like the puzzles raised byequilibrium refinement, is mainly a problem for those who view gametheory as contributing to a normative theory of rationality(specifically, as contributing to that larger theory the theory of<em>strategic</em> rationality). The non-psychological game theoristcan give a different sort of account of apparently “irrational” playand the prudence it encourages. This involves appeal to the empiricalfact that actual agents, including people, must <em>learn</em> theequilibrium strategies of games they play, at least whenever the gamesare at all complicated. Research shows that even a game as simple asthe Prisoner's Dilemma requires learning by people(<a href="#Led95">Ledyard 1995</a>, <a href="#Sal95">Sally 1995</a>, <a href="#Cam03">Camerer 2003</a>, p. 265). What it means to say that people must learn equilibriumstrategies is that we must be a bit more sophisticated than wasindicated earlier in constructing utility functions from behavior inapplication of Revealed Preference Theory. Instead of constructingutility functions on the basis of single episodes, we must do so onthe basis of observed runs of behavior <em>once it hasstabilized</em>, signifying maturity of learning for the subjects inquestion and the game in question. Once again, the Prisoner's Dilemmamakes a good example. People encounter few one-shot Prisoner'sDilemmas in everyday life, but they encounter many <em>repeated</em>PD's with non-strangers. As a result, when set into what is intended tobe a one-shot PD in the experimental laboratory, people tend toinitially play as if the game were a single round of a repeatedPD. The repeated PD has many Nash equilibria that involve cooperationrather than defection. Thus experimental subjects tend to cooperate atfirst in these circumstances, but learn after some number of rounds todefect. The experimenter cannot infer that she has successfullyinduced a one-shot PD with her experimental setup until she sees thisbehavior stabilize.</p> <p>If players of games realize that other players may need to learn gamestructures and equilibria from experience, this gives them reason totake account of what happens off the equilibrium paths ofextensive-form games. Of course, if a player fears that other playershave not learned equilibrium, this may well remove her incentive toplay an equilibrium strategy herself. This raises a set of deepproblems about social learning (<a href="#Fud98">Fudenberg and Levine 1998</a>. How do ignorant players learn to play equilibria ifsophisticated players don't show them, because the sophisticated areincentivized to play equilibrium strategies until the ignorant havelearned? The crucial answer in the case of applications of game theoryto interactions among people is that young peopleare <em>socialized</em> by growing up in networksof <em>institutions</em>, including <em>cultural norms</em>. Mostcomplex games that people play are already in progress among peoplewho were socialized before them—that is, have learned gamestructures and equilibria (<a href="#Ros08">Ross 2008</a>. Novicesmust then only copy those whose play appears to be expected andunderstood by others. Institutions and norms are rich with reminders,including homilies and easily remembered rules of thumb, to helppeople remember what they are doing <a href="#Cla97">(Clark1997)</a>.</p> <p> As noted in <a href="#IP">Section 2.7</a> above, when observed behaviordoes <em>not</em> stabilize around equilibria in a game, and there isno evidence that learning is still in process, the analyst shouldinfer that she has incorrectly modeled the situation she isstudying. Chances are that she has either mis-specified players'utility functions, the strategies available to the players, or theinformation that is available to them. Given the complexity of many ofthe situations that social scientists study, we should not besurprised that mis-specification of models happens frequently. Appliedgame theorists must do lots of learning, just like their subjects.</p> <p> Thus the paradox of backward induction is only apparent. Unlessplayers have experienced play at equilibrium with one another in thepast, even if they are all economically rational and all believe thisabout one another, we should predict that they will attach somepositive probability to the conjecture that understanding of gamestructures among some players is imperfect. This then explains whyeconomically rational agents may often play as if they believe intrembling hands.</p> <p> Learning of equilibria may take various forms fordifferent agents and for games of differing levels of complexity andrisk. Incorporating it into game-theoretic models of interactions thusintroduces an extensive new set of technicalities. For the most fullydeveloped general theory, the reader is referred to <a href="#Fud98">Fudenberg and Levine (1998)</a>. </p> <h2><a name="Uncer">3. Uncertainty, Risk and Sequential Equilibria</a></h2> <p>The games we've modeled to this point have all involved playerschoosing from amongst <em>pure strategies</em>, in which each seeks asingle optimal course of action at each node that constitutes a bestreply to the actions of others. Often, however, a player's utility isoptimized through use of a <em>mixed</em> strategy, in which she flipsa weighted coin amongst several possible actions. (We will see laterthat there is an alternative interpretation of mixing, not involvingrandomization at a particular information set; but we will start herefrom the coin-flipping interpretation and then build on it in <a href="#Beliefs">Section 3.1</a>.) Mixing is called for whenever no pure strategy maximizes the player'sutility against all opponent strategies. Our river-crossing game from <a href="#Mot">Section 1</a> exemplifies this. As we saw, the puzzle in that game consists in thefact that if the fugitive's reasoning selects a particular bridge asoptimal, his pursuer must be assumed to be able to duplicate thatreasoning. The fugitive can escape only if his pursuer cannotreliably predict which bridge he'll use. Symmetry of logical reasoningpower on the part of the two players ensures that the fugitive cansurprise the pursuer only if it is possible for him to surprise<em>himself</em>.</p> <p>Suppose that we ignore rocks and cobras for a moment, and imagine thatthe bridges are equally safe. Suppose also that the fugitive has nospecial knowledge about his pursuer that might lead him to venture aspecially conjectured probability distribution over the pursuer'savailable strategies. In this case, the fugitive's best course is toroll a three-sided die, in which each side represents a differentbridge (or, more conventionally, a six-sided die in which each bridgeis represented by two sides). He must then pre-commit himself to usingwhichever bridge is selected by this <em>randomizing device</em>. Thisfixes the odds of his survival regardless of what the pursuer does;but since the pursuer has no reason to prefer any available pure ormixed strategy, and since in any case we are presuming her epistemicsituation to be symmetrical to that of the fugitive, we may supposethat she will roll a three-sided die of her own. The fugitive now hasa 2/3 probability of escaping and the pursuer a 1/3 probability ofcatching him. Neither the fugitive nor the pursuer can improve theirchances given the other's randomizing mix, so the two randomizingstrategies are in Nash equilibrium. Note that if <em>one</em> playeris randomizing then the other does equally well on <em>any</em> mix ofprobabilities over bridges, so there are infinitely many combinations of best replies. However,each player should worry that anything other than a random strategymight be coordinated with some factor the other player can detect andexploit. Since any non-random strategy is exploitable by another non-random strategy, in a zero-sum game such as our example, only the vector of randomized strategies is a NE.</p> <p>Now let us re-introduce the parametric factors, that is, the fallingrocks at bridge #2 and the cobras at bridge #3. Again, suppose thatthe fugitive is sure to get safely across bridge #1, has a 90% chanceof crossing bridge #2, and an 80% chance of crossing bridge #3. We cansolve this new game if we make certain assumptions about the twoplayers' utility functions. Suppose that Player 1, the fugitive, caresonly about living or dying (preferring life to death) while thepursuer simply wishes to be able to report that the fugitive is dead,preferring this to having to report that he got away. (In other words,neither player cares about <em>how</em> the fugitive lives or dies.)In this case, the fugitive simply takes his original randomizingformula and weights it according to the different levels of parametricdanger at the three bridges. Each bridge should be thought of as a<em>lottery</em> over the fugitive's possible outcomes, in which eachlottery has a different <em>expected payoff</em> in terms of the itemsin his utility function.&nbsp;</p> <p>Consider matters from the pursuer's point of view. She will be usingher prudent NE strategy when she chooses the mix of probabilities over thethree bridges that makes the fugitive indifferent among his possiblepure strategies. The bridge with rocks is 1.1 times more dangerous forhim than the safe bridge. Therefore, he will be indifferent betweenthe two when the pursuer is 1.1 times more likely to be waiting at thesafe bridge than the rocky bridge. The cobra bridge is 1.2 times moredangerous for the fugitive than the safe bridge. Therefore, he will beindifferent between these two bridges when the pursuer's probabilityof waiting at the safe bridge is 1.2 times higher than the probabilitythat she is at the cobra bridge. Suppose we use s1, s2 and s3 torepresent the fugitive's parametric survival rates at eachbridge. Then the pursuer minimizes the net survival rate across anypair of bridges by adjusting the probabilities p1 and p2 that she willwait at them so that</p> <blockquote> s1 (1 − p1) = s2 (1 − p2) </blockquote> <p>Since p1 + p2 = 1, we can rewrite this as</p> <blockquote> s1 &times; p2 = s2 &times; p1 </blockquote> <p>so</p> <blockquote> p1/s1 = p2/s2. </blockquote> <p>Thus the pursuer finds her prudent NE strategy by solving the followingsimultaneous equations:</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>1 (1 − p1)</td> <td>=</td> <td>0.9 (1 − p2)</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>=</td> <td>0.8 (1 − p3)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>p1 + p2 + p3 = 1.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>p1</td> <td>=</td> <td>49/121</td> </tr> <tr> <td>p2</td> <td>=</td> <td>41/121</td> </tr> <tr> <td>p3</td> <td>=</td> <td>31/121</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </blockquote> <p>Now let f1, f2, f3 represent the probabilities with which the fugitivechooses each respective bridge. Then the fugitive finds his prudent NEstrategy by solving</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>s1 &times; f1</td> <td>=</td> <td>s2 &times; f2</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>=</td> <td>s3 &times; f3</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </blockquote> <p>so</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>1 &times; f1</td> <td>=</td> <td>0.9 &times; f2</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>=</td> <td>0.8 &times; f3</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </blockquote> <p>simultaneously with</p> <blockquote> f1 + f2 + f3 = 1. </blockquote> <p>Then</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>f1 = 36/121</td> </tr> <tr> <td>f2 = 40/121</td> </tr> <tr> <td>f3 = 45/121</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </blockquote> <p>These two sets of NE probabilities tell each player how to weight hisor her die before throwing it. Note the — perhaps surprising— result that the fugitive uses riskier bridges with <em> higher</em> probability. This is the only way of making the pursuerindifferent over which bridge she stakes out, which in turn is whatmaximizes the fugitive's probability of survival.</p> <p>We were able to solve this game straightforwardly because we set theutility functions in such a way as to make it <em>zero-sum</em>, or<em>strictly competitive</em>. That is, every gain in expected utilityby one player represents a precisely symmetrical loss by the other.However, this condition may often not hold. Suppose now that theutility functions are more complicated. The pursuer most prefers anoutcome in which she shoots the fugitive and so claims credit for hisapprehension to one in which he dies of rockfall or snakebite; and sheprefers this second outcome to his escape. The fugitive prefers aquick death by gunshot to the pain of being crushed or the terror ofan encounter with a cobra. Most of all, of course, he prefers toescape. We cannot solve this game, as before, simply on the basis ofknowing the players' ordinal utility functions, since the<em>intensities</em> of their respective preferences will now berelevant to their strategies.</p> <p>Prior to the work of <a href="#Neu47">von Neumann &amp; Morgenstern (1947)</a>, situations of this sort were inherently baffling to analysts. This isbecause utility does not denote a hidden psychological variable suchas <em>pleasure</em>. As we discussed in <a href="#Util">Section 2.1</a>, utility is merely a measure of relative behavioural dispositionsgiven certain consistency assumptions about relations betweenpreferences and choices. It therefore makes no sense to imaginecomparing our players' <em>cardinal</em>—that is,intensity-sensitive—preferences with one another's, since thereis no independent, interpersonally constant yardstick we coulduse. How, then, can we model games in which cardinal information isrelevant? After all, modeling games requires that all players'utilities be taken simultaneously into account, as we've seen.</p> <p>A crucial aspect of <a href="#Neu47">von Neumann &amp; Morgenstern's (1947)</a> work was the solution to this problem. Here, we will provide a briefoutline of their ingenious technique for building cardinal utilityfunctions out of ordinal ones. It is emphasized that what follows ismerely an <em>outline</em>, so as to make cardinal utilitynon-mysterious to you as a student who is interested in knowing aboutthe philosophical foundations of game theory, and about the range ofproblems to which it can be applied. Providing a manual you couldfollow in <em>building</em> your own cardinal utility functions wouldrequire many pages. Such manuals are available in manytextbooks.</p> <p>Suppose we have an agent whose ordinal utility function is known.Indeed, suppose that it's our river-crossing fugitive. Let's assign himthe following ordinal utility function:</p> <blockquote> Escape ≫ 4 <p>Death by shooting ≫ 3</p> <p>Death by rockfall ≫ 2</p> <p>Death by snakebite ≫ 1</p> </blockquote> <p>Now, we know that his preference for escape over <em>any</em> form ofdeath is likely to be stronger than his preference for, say, shootingover snakebite. This should be reflected in his choice behaviour inthe following way. In a situation such as the river-crossing game, heshould be willing to run greater risks to increase the relativeprobability of escape over shooting than he is to increase therelative probability of shooting over snakebite. This bit of logic isthe crucial insight behind <a href="#Neu47">von Neumann &amp; Morgenstern's (1947)</a> solution to the cardinalization problem. </p> <p>Begin by asking our agent to pick, from the available set of outcomes,a <em>best</em> one and a <em>worst</em> one. ‘Best’ and‘worst’ are defined in terms of a principle of decisiontheory: an economically rational agent chooses so as to maximize theprobability of the best outcome—callthis <strong>W</strong>—and to minimize the probability of theworst outcome—call this<strong>L</strong>. Now consider prizes intermediate between<strong>W</strong> and <strong>L</strong>. We find, for a set ofoutcomes containing such prizes, a lottery over them such that ouragent is indifferent between that lottery and a lottery including only<strong>W</strong> and <strong>L</strong>. In our example, this wouldbe a lottery having shooting and rockfall as its possible outcomes.Call this lottery <strong>T</strong> . We define a utility function<em>q</em> = <em>u</em>(<strong>T</strong>) such that if <em>q</em> isthe expected prize in <strong>T</strong> , the agent is indifferentbetween winning <strong>T</strong> and winning a lottery in which<strong>W</strong> occurs with probability<em>u</em>(<strong>T</strong>) and <strong>L</strong> occurs withprobability 1&nbsp;−&nbsp;<em>u</em>(<strong>T</strong>).</p> <p>We now construct a <em>compound lottery</em> <strong>T</strong>* overthe outcome set {<strong>W</strong>, <strong>L</strong>} such that theagent is indifferent between <strong>T</strong> and<strong>T</strong>*. A compound lottery is one in which the prize inthe lottery is another lottery. This makes sense because, after all,it is still <strong>W</strong> and <strong>L</strong> that are atstake for our agent in both cases; so we can then analyze<strong>T</strong>* into a simple lottery over <strong>W</strong> and<strong>L</strong>. Call this lottery <strong>r</strong>. It followsfrom transitivity that <strong>T</strong> is equivalent to<strong>r</strong>. (Note that this presupposes that our agent doesnot gain utility from the complexity of her gambles.) The agent willnow choose the action that maximizes the probability ofwinning <strong>W</strong>. The mapping from the set of outcomes to<em>u</em>(<strong>r</strong>) is a <em>von Neumann-Morgensternutility function</em> (VNMuf).</p> <p>What exactly have we done here? We've simply given our agent choicesover lotteries, instead of over prizes directly, and observed how muchextra risk he's willing to run to increase the chances of winningescape over snakebite relative to getting shot or clobbered with arock. A VNMuf yields a <em>cardinal</em>, rather than an ordinal,measure of utility. Our choice of endpoint-values, <strong>W</strong>and <strong>L</strong>, is arbitrary, as before; but once these arefixed the values of the intermediate points are determined. Therefore,the VNMuf <em>does</em> measure the relative preference intensities ofa single agent. However, since our assignment of utility values to<strong>W</strong> and <strong>L</strong> <em>is</em> arbitrary, wecan't use VNMufs to compare the cardinal preferences of one agent withthose of another. Furthermore, since we are using a<em>risk-metric</em> as our measuring instrument, the construction ofthe new utility function depends on assuming that our agent's<em>attitude to risk itself</em> stays constant from one comparison oflotteries to another. This seems reasonable for a single agent in asingle game-situation. However, two agents in one game, or one agentunder different sorts of circumstances, may display very differentattitudes to risk. Perhaps in the river-crossing game the pursuer,whose life is not at stake, will enjoy gambling with her glory whileour fugitive is cautious. In general, a <em>risk-averse</em> agentprefers a guaranteed prize to its equivalent expected value in alottery. A <em>risk-loving</em> agent has the reverse preference. A<em>risk-neutral</em> agent is indifferent between these options. Inanalyzing the river-crossing game, however, we don't <em>have to</em>be able to compare the pursuer's cardinal utilities with thefugitive's. Both agents, after all, can find their NE strategies ifthey can estimate the probabilities each will assign to the actions ofthe other. This means that each must know both VNMufs; but neitherneed try to comparatively value the outcomes over which they'regambling.</p> <p>We can now fill in the rest of the matrix for the bridge-crossing gamethat we started to draw in Section 2. If all that the fugitive caresabout is life and death, but not the manner of death, and if all thehunter cares about is preventing the fugitive from escaping, then wecan now interpret both utility functions cardinally. This permits usto assign expected utilities, expressed by multiplying the originalpayoffs by the relevant probabilities, as outcomes in the matrix.Suppose that the hunter waits at the cobra bridge with probability<em>x</em> and at the rocky bridge with probability <em>y</em>. Sinceher probabilities across the three bridges must sum to 1, this impliesthat she must wait at the safe bridge with probability 1 −(<em>x</em> + <em>y</em>). Then, continuing to assign the fugitive apayoff of 0 if he dies and 1 if he escapes, and the hunter the reversepayoffs, our complete matrix is as follows:</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure12.jpg" alt="Figure 12" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 12</strong> </blockquote> <p>We can now read the following facts about the game directly from thematrix. No pair of pure strategies is a pair of best replies to theother. Therefore, the game's only NE require at least one player touse a mixed strategy.</p> <h3><a name="Beliefs">3.1 Beliefs</a></h3> <p>How should we interpret the processes being modeled by computations ofNE strategy mixes in games like the river-crossing one? One possiblekind of interpretation is an <em> evolutionary </em> one. If thehunter and the fugitive have regularly played games that structurally<em>resemble</em> this river-crossing game, then selection pressureswill have encouraged habits in them that lead them both to play NEstrategies <em>and to sincerely rationalize doing so</em> by means ofsome satisfying story or other. If neither party has ever been in asituation like this, and if their biological and/or cultural ancestorshaven't either, and if neither is concerned with revealing informationto opponents in expected future situations of this sort (because theydon't expect them to arise again),and if both parties aren't trainedgame theorists, then their behavior should be predicted not by a gametheorist but by friends of theirs who are familiar with their personalidiosyncrasies. The spirit of science should be comfortable with theidea that game theory isn't useful for modelling every possibleempirical circumstance that comes along.</p> <p>However, the philosopher who wants game theory to serve as adescriptive and/or normative theory of strategic rationality cannotrest content with this answer. He must find a satisfying line ofadvice for the players even when their game is alone in the universeof strategic problems, unless he is prepared to admit that rationalitymight recommend no definite course of action even in a situation whereall relevant parameters are known. No such advice can be given that is<em>uncontroversially</em> satisfactory. A non-psychological gametheorist, after all, may favor this stance <em>because</em> she isn'tsatisfied by any available approach here—and because she fearsthe effort leaves empirical science behind. However, there is a way ofhandling the matter that many game theorists have found worthy ofdetailed pursuit. This involves the computation of <em>equilibria inbeliefs</em>.</p> <p>In fact, the the non-psychological game theorist can borrow theconcept of equilibrium in beliefs for different purposes. As we'veseen, the concept of NE sometimes doesn't go deep enough as ananalytical instrument to tell us all that we think might be importantin a game. Thus even the analyst who isn't impressed with the projectof developing refinements for the sake of satisfying a prioriintuitions about the concept of rationality might make use of theconcept of subgame-perfect equilibrium (SPE), as discussed in <a href="#Subgame">Section 2.6</a>, if they think they're dealing with agents who are very well informed(say, because they're in a familiar and strongly prescriptiveinstitutional setting). But now consider the three-playerimperfect-information game below known as ‘Selten's horse’(for its inventor, Nobel Laureate Reinhard Selten, and because of theshape of its tree; taken from <a href="#Kre90">Kreps (1990)</a>, p. 426):</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure13.jpg" alt="Figure 13" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 13</strong> </blockquote> <p>One of the NE of this game is Lr<sub>2</sub>l<sub>3</sub>. This isbecause if Player I plays L, then Player II playing r<sub>2</sub> hasno incentive to change strategies because her only node of action, 12,is off the path of play. But this NE seems to be purely technical; itmakes little sense as a solution. This reveals itself in the fact thatif the game beginning at node 14 could be treated as a subgame,Lr<sub>2</sub>l<sub>3</sub> would not be an SPE. Whenever she<em>does</em> get a move, Player II should play l<sub>2</sub>. But ifPlayer II is playing l<sub>2</sub> then Player I should switch toR. In that case Player III should switch to r<sub>3</sub>, sendingPlayer II back to r<sub>2</sub>. And here's a new,‘sensible’, NE: Rr<sub>2</sub>r<sub>3</sub>. I and II ineffect play ‘keepaway’ from III.</p> <p>This NE is stable under learning by players in just the same way that a SPEoutcome in a perfect-information game is more stable than othernon-SPE NE. However, we can't select it by applying Zermelo'salgorithm. Because nodes 13 and 14 fall inside a common informationset, Selten's Horse has only one subgame (namely, the whole game). Weneed a ‘cousin’ concept to SPE that we can apply in casesof imperfect information, and we need a new solution procedure toreplace Zermelo's algorithm for such games.</p> <p>Notice what Player III in Selten's Horse might wonder about as heselects his strategy. “Given that I get a move,” he asks himself, “wasmy action node reached from node 11 or from node 12?” What, in otherwords, are the <em>conditional probabilities</em> that Player III isat node 13 or 14 given that he has a move? Now, if conditionalprobabilities are what Player III wonders about, then what Players Iand II must make conjectures about when they select <em>their</em>strategies are Player III's estimates of these conditionalprobabilities. These estimates are referred to as‘beliefs’. This usage need not require that we imagine anymental state, conscious or otherwise; a belief in this sense need onlybe an expectation implicit in behavior. Player I, to conjecture aboutPlayer III's beliefs, might conjecture about Player II's beliefs aboutPlayers III's beliefs, and Player III's beliefs about Player II'sbeliefs and so on. The relevant beliefs here are not merely strategic,as before, since they are not just about what players will <em>do</em>given a set of payoffs and game structures, but about whichdistributions of probabilities are mutually consistent given that theyare conditional on one another.</p> <p>What beliefs about conditional probability is it reasonable forplayers to expect from each other? The normative theorist might insiston whatever the best mathematicians have discovered about the subject.Clearly, however, if this is applied then a theory of games thatincorporated it would not be descriptively true of most people. Thenon-psychological game theorist should consider only expectations thata plausible natural process of biological or, in the case of people,cultural and institutional selection, might inculcate. Perhaps someagents might follow habits that respect<em>Bayes's rule</em>, which is the minimal true generalization aboutconditional probability that an agent could know if it knows any suchgeneralizations at all. Adding more sophisticated knowledge aboutconditional probability amounts to refining the concept ofequilibrium-in-belief, just as some game theorists refine NE. Suchrefinements will tend only to be empirically plausible when applied tohighly competitive markets in which it is worth players' while tointensively invest in expensive computational resources (e.g.,financial markets).</p> <p>Here, we will restrict our attention to the least refinedequilibrium-in-belief concept, that obtained when we require players' expectations toaccord with Bayes's rule. This rule tells us how tocompute the probability of an event F given information E (written‘pr(F/E)’):</p> <blockquote> pr(F/E) = [pr(E/F) &times; pr(F)] / pr(E) </blockquote> <p>We will henceforth assume that players do not hold beliefsinconsistent with this equality.</p> <p>We may now define a <em>sequential equilibrium</em>. A SE has twoparts: (1) a strategy profile &sect; for each player, as before, and(2) a <em>system of beliefs</em> μ for each player. μ assignsto each information set <em>h</em> a probability distribution over thenodes <em>x</em> in <em>h</em>, with the interpretation that these arethe beliefs of player <em>i</em>(<em>h</em>) about where in hisinformation set he is, given that information set <em>h</em> has beenreached. Then a sequential equilibrium is a profile of strategies&sect; and a system of beliefs μ consistent with Bayes's rule suchthat starting from every information set <em>h</em> in the tree player<em>i</em>(<em>h</em>) plays optimally from then on, given that whathe believes to have transpired previously is given by μ(<em>h</em>)and what will transpire at subsequent moves is given by &sect;.</p> <p>We now demonstrate the concept by application to Selten'sHorse. Consider again the uninteresting NELr<sub>2</sub>l<sub>3</sub>. Suppose that Player III assigns pr(1) toher belief that if she gets a move she is at node 13. Then Player II,given a consistent μ(II), must believe that Player III will playl<sub>3</sub>, in which case her only SE strategy is l<sub>2</sub>. Soalthough Lr<sub>2</sub>l<sub>3</sub> is a NE, it is not a SE. This isof course what we want.</p> <p>The use of the consistency requirement in this example is somewhattrivial, so consider now a second case (also taken from <a href="#Kre90">Kreps (1990)</a>, p. 429):</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure14.jpg" alt="Figure 14" width="550" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 14</strong> </blockquote> <p>Suppose that Player I plays L, Player II plays l<sub>2</sub> and Player III playsl<sub>3</sub>. Suppose also that μ(II) assigns pr(.3) to node16. In that case, l<sub>2</sub> is not a SE strategy for Player II, sincel<sub>2</sub> returns an expected payoff of .3(4) + .7(2) = 2.6, whiler<sub>2</sub> brings an expected payoff of 3.1. Notice that if wefiddle the strategy profile for player III while leaving everythingelse fixed, l<sub>2</sub> could <em>become</em> a SE strategy forPlayer II. If &sect;(III) yielded a play of l<sub>3</sub> with pr(.5) andr<sub>3</sub> with pr(.5), then if Player II plays r<sub>2</sub> his expectedpayoff would now be 2.2, so Ll<sub>2</sub>l<sub>3</sub> would be a SE.Now imagine setting μ(III) back as it was, but change μ(II) sothat Player II thinks the conditional probability of being at node 16 isgreater than .5; in that case, l<sub>2</sub> is again not a SEstrategy.</p> <p>The idea of SE is hopefully now clear. We can apply it to theriver-crossing game in a way that avoids the necessity for the pursuerto flip any coins of we modify the game a bit. Suppose now that thepursuer can change bridges twice during the fugitive's passage, andwill catch him just in case she meets him as he leaves thebridge. Then the pursuer's SE strategy is to divide her time at thethree bridges in accordance with the proportion given by the equationin the third paragraph of Section 3 above.</p> <p>It must be noted that since Bayes's rule cannot be applied to eventswith probability 0, its application to SE requires that players assignnon-zero probabilities to all actions available in extensive form. Thisrequirement is captured by supposing that all strategy profiles be<em>strictly mixed</em>, that is, that every action at everyinformation set be taken with positive probability. You will see thatthis is just equivalent to supposing that all hands sometimes tremble,or alternatively that no expectations are quite certain. A SE is saidto be <em>trembling-hand perfect</em> if all strategies played atequilibrium are best replies to strategies that are strictlymixed. You should also not be surprised to be told that no weaklydominated strategy can be trembling-hand perfect, since thepossibility of trembling hands gives players the most persuasivereason for avoiding such strategies.</p> <h2><a name="Repeat">4. Repeated Games and Coordination</a></h2> <p>So far we've restricted our attention to <em>one-shot</em> games, thatis, games in which players' strategic concerns extend no further thanthe terminal nodes of their single interaction. However, games areoften played with <em>future</em> games in mind, and this cansignificantly alter their outcomes and equilibrium strategies. Ourtopic in this section is <em>repeated games</em>, that is, games inwhich sets of players expect to face each other in similar situationson multiple occasions. We approach these first through the limitedcontext of repeated prisoner's dilemmas. </p> <p>We've seen that in the one-shot PD the only NE is mutual defection.This may no longer hold, however, if the players expect to meet eachother again in future PDs. Imagine that four firms, all making widgets,agree to maintain high prices by jointly restricting supply. (That is,they form a cartel.) This will only work if each firm maintains itsagreed production quota. Typically, each firm can maximize its profitby departing from its quota while the others observe theirs, since itthen sells more units at the higher market price brought about by thealmost-intact cartel. In the one-shot case, all firms would share thisincentive to defect and the cartel would immediately collapse. However,the firms expect to face each other in competition for a long period.In this case, each firm knows that if it breaks the cartel agreement,the others can punish it by underpricing it for a period long enough tomore than eliminate its short-term gain. Of course, the punishing firmswill take short-term losses too during their period of underpricing.But these losses may be worth taking if they serve to reestablish thecartel and bring about maximum long-term prices.</p> <p>One simple, and famous (but <em>not</em>, contrary to widespreadmyth, necessarily optimal) strategy for preserving cooperation inrepeated PDs is called <em>tit-for-tat</em>. This strategy tells eachplayer to behave as follows:</p> <ol type="i"> <li>Always cooperate in the first round.</li> <li>Thereafter, take whatever action your opponent took in the previousround.</li> </ol> <p>A group of players <em>all</em> playing tit-for-tat will never see anydefections. Since, in a population where others play tit-for-tat,tit-for-tat is the rational response for each player, everyone playingtit-for-tat is a NE. You may frequently hear people who know a<em>little</em> (but not enough) game theory talk as if this is the endof the story. It is not. </p> <p>There are two complications. First, the players must be uncertain asto when their interaction ends. Suppose the players know when the lastround comes. In that round, it will be utility-maximizing for playersto defect, since no punishment will be possible. Now consider thesecond-last round. In this round, players also face no punishment fordefection, since they expect to defect in the last round anyway. Sothey defect in the second-last round. But this means they face nothreat of punishment in the third-last round, and defect there too. Wecan simply iterate this backwards through the game tree until we reachthe first round. Since cooperation is not a NE strategy in that round,tit-for-tat is no longer a NE strategy in the repeated game, and weget the same outcome—mutual defection—as in the one-shotPD. Therefore, cooperation is only possible in repeated PDs where theexpected number of repetitions is indeterminate. (Of course, this doesapply to many real-life games.) Note that in this context any amountof uncertainty in expectations, or possibility of trembling hands,will be conducive to cooperation, at least for awhile. When people inexperiments play repeated PDs with known end-points, they indeed tendto cooperate for awhile, but learn to defect earlier as they gainexperience.</p> <p>Now we introduce a second complication. Suppose that players'ability to distinguish defection from cooperation is imperfect.Consider our case of the widget cartel. Suppose the players observe afall in the market price of widgets. Perhaps this is because a cartelmember cheated. Or perhaps it has resulted from an exogenous drop indemand. If tit-for-tat players mistake the second case for the first,they will defect, thereby setting off a chain-reaction of mutualdefections from which they can never recover, since everyplayer will reply to the first encountered defection with defection,thereby begetting further defections, and so on.</p> <p>If players know that such miscommunication is possible, they haveincentive to resort to more sophisticated strategies. In particular,they may be prepared to sometimes risk following defections withcooperation in order to test their inferences. However, if theyare <em>too</em> forgiving, then other players can exploit themthrough additional defections. In general, sophisticated strategieshave a problem. Because they are more difficult for other players toinfer, their use increases the probability of miscommunication. Butmiscommunication is what causes repeated-game cooperative equilibriato unravel in the first place. The complexities surroundinginformation signaling, screening and inference in repeated PDs help tointuitively explain the <em>folk theorem</em>, so called because noone is sure who first recognized it, that in repeated PDs,for <em>any</em> strategy <em>S</em> there exists a possibledistribution of strategies among other players such that the vectorof <em>S</em> and these other strategies is a NE. Thus there isnothing special, after all, about tit-for-tat.</p> <p>Real, complex, social and political dramas are seldomstraightforward instantiations of simple games such as PDs. <a href="#Har95">Hardin (1995)</a>offers an analysis of two tragically real political cases, theYugoslavian civil war of 1991–95, and the 1994 Rwandan genocide, asPDs that were nested inside <em>coordination games</em>.</p> <p>A coordination game occurs whenever the utility of two or more playersis maximized by their doing the same thing as one another, and wheresuch correspondence is more important to them than whatever it is, inparticular, that they both do. A standard example arises with rules ofthe road: ‘All drive on the left’ and ‘All drive onthe right’ are both outcomes that are NEs, and neither is moreefficient than the other. In games of ‘pure’ coordination,it doesn't even help to use more selective equilibrium criteria. Forexample, suppose that we require our players to reason in accordancewith Bayes's rule (see Section 3 above). In these circumstances, anystrategy that is a best reply to any vector of mixed strategiesavailable in NE is said to be <em>rationalizable</em>. That is, aplayer can find a set of systems of beliefs for the other players suchthat any history of the game along an equilibrium path is consistentwith that set of systems. Pure coordination games are characterized bynon-unique vectors of rationalizable strategies. In such situations,players may try to predict equilibria by searching for <em>focalpoints</em>, that is, features of some strategies that they believewill be salient to other players, and that they believe other playerswill believe to be salient to them. For example, if two people want tomeet on a given day in a big city but can't contact each other toarrange a specific time and place, both might sensibly go to thecity's most prominent downtown plaza at noon. In general, the betterplayers know one another, or the more often they have been able toobserve one another's strategic behavior, the more likely they are tosucceed in finding focal points on which to coordinate. </p> <p>Coordination was, indeed, the first topic of game-theoreticapplication that came to the widespread attention of philosophers. In1969, the philosopher <a href="#Lew69">David Lewis (1969)</a>published <em>Convention</em>, in which the conceptual framework ofgame-theory was applied to one of the fundamental issues oftwentieth-century epistemology, the nature and extent of conventionsgoverning semantics and their relationship to the justification ofpropositional beliefs. The basic insight can be captured using asimple example. The word ‘chicken’ denotes chickens and‘ostrich’ denotes ostriches. We would not be better orworse off if ‘chicken’ denoted ostriches and‘ostrich’ denoted chickens; however, we <em>would</em> beworse off if half of us used the pair of words the first way and halfthe second, or if all of us randomized between them to refer toflightless birds generally. This insight, of course, well precededLewis; but what he recognized is that this situation has the logicalform of a coordination game. Thus, while particular conventions may bearbitrary, the interactive structures that stabilize and maintain themare not. Furthermore, the equilibria involved in coordinating on nounmeanings appear to have an arbitrary element only because we cannotPareto-rank them; but <a href="#Mil84">Millikan (1984)</a> shows implicitly that in thisrespect they are atypical of linguistic coordinations. They arecertainly atypical of coordinating conventions in general, a point onwhich Lewis was misled by over-valuing ‘semanticintuitions’ about ‘the meaning’of‘convention’ (<a href="#Bac06">Bacharach 2006</a>, <a href="#Ros08">Ross 2008</a>).</p> <p> <a href="#Ros95">Ross &amp; LaCasse (1995)</a> present the followingexample of a real-life coordination game in which the NE are notPareto-indifferent, but the Pareto-inferior NE is more frequentlyobserved. In a city, drivers must coordinate on one of two NE withrespect to their behaviour at traffic lights. Either all must followthe strategy of rushing to try to race through lights that turn yellow(or amber) and pausing before proceeding when red lights shift togreen, or all must follow the strategy of slowing down on yellows andjumping immediately off on shifts to green. Both patterns are NE, inthat once a community has coordinated on one of them then noindividual has an incentive to deviate: those who slow down on yellowswhile others are rushing them will get rear-ended, while those whorush yellows in the other equilibrium will risk collision with thosewho jump off straightaway on greens. Therefore, once a city's trafficpattern settles on one of these equilibria it will tend to staythere. And, indeed, these are the two patterns that are observed inthe world's cities. However, the two equilibria are notPareto-indifferent, since the second NE allows more cars to turn lefton each cycle in a left-hand-drive jurisdiction, and right on eachcycle in a right-hand jurisdiction, which reduces the main cause ofbottlenecks in urban road networks and allows all drivers to expectgreater efficiency in getting about. Unfortunately, for reasons aboutwhich we can only speculate pending further empirical work andanalysis, far more cities are locked onto the Pareto-inferior NE thanon the Pareto-superior one.</p> <p>Conventions on standards of evidence and scientific rationality, thetopics from philosophy of science that set up the context for Lewis'sanalysis, are likely to be of the Pareto-rankable character. Whilevarious arrangements might be NE in the social game of science, asfollowers of Thomas Kuhn like to remind us, it is highly improbablethat all of these lie on a single Pareto-indifference curve. Thesethemes, strongly represented in contemporary epistemology, philosophyof science and philosophy of language, are all at least implicitapplications of game theory. (The reader can find a broad sample ofapplications, and references to the large literature, in <a href="#Noz98">Nozick (1998)</a>.)</p> <p>Most of the social and political coordination games played by peoplealso have this feature. Unfortunately for us all, inefficiency trapsrepresented by Pareto-inferior NE are extremely common in them. Andsometimes dynamics of this kind give rise to the most terrible of allrecurrent human collective behaviors. Hardin's analysis of two recentgenocidal episodes relies on the idea that the biologically shallowproperties by which people sort themselves into racial and ethnicgroups serve highly efficiently as focal points in coordination games,which in turn produce deadly PDs between them.</p> <p>According to Hardin, neither the Yugoslavian nor the Rwandan disasterswere PDs to begin with. That is, in neither situation, on either side,did most people begin by preferring the destruction of the other tomutual cooperation. However, the deadly logic of coordination,deliberately abetted by self-serving politicians,dynamically <em>created</em> PDs. Some individual Serbs (Hutus) wereencouraged to perceive their individual interests as best servedthrough identification with Serbian (Hutu) group-interests. That is,they found that some of their circumstances, such as those involvingcompetition for jobs, had the form of coordination games. They thusacted so as to create situations in which this was true for otherSerbs (Hutus) as well. Eventually, once enough Serbs (Hutus)identified self-interest with group-interest, the identificationbecame almost universally <em>correct</em>, because (1) the mostimportant goal for each Serb (Hutu) was to do roughly what every otherSerb (Hutu) would, and (2) the most distinctively <em>Serbian</em>thing to do, the doing of which signalled coordination, was to excludeCroats (Tutsi). That is, strategies involving such exclusionarybehavior were selected as a result of having efficient focalpoints. This situation made it the case that an individual—andindividually threatened—Croat's (Tutsi's) self-interest was bestmaximized by coordinating on assertive Croat (Tutsi) group-identity,which further increased pressures on Serbs (Hutus) to coordinate, andso on. Note that it is not an aspect of this analysis to suggest thatSerbs or Hutus started things; the process could have been (even if itwasn't in fact) perfectly reciprocal. But the outcome is ghastly:Serbs and Croats (Hutus and Tutsis) seem progressively morethreatening to each other as they rally together for self-defense,until both see it as imperative to preempt their rivals and strikebefore being struck. If Hardin is right—and the point here isnot to claim that he <em>is</em>, but rather to point out the worldlyimportance of determining which games agents are in factplaying—then the mere presence of an external enforcer (NATO?)would not have changed the game, pace the Hobbesian analysis, sincethe enforcer could not have threatened either side with anything worsethan what each feared from the other. What was needed wasrecalibration of evaluations of interests, which (arguably) happenedin Yugoslavia when the Croatian army began to decisively win, at whichpoint Bosnian Serbs decided that their self/group interests werebetter served by the arrival of NATO peacekeepers. The Rwandangenocide likewise ended with a military solution, in this case a Tutsivictory. (But this became the seed for the most deadly war on earthsince 1945, the Congo War of 1998–2006.)</p> <p>Of course, it is not the case that most repeated games lead todisasters. The biological basis of friendship in people and otheranimals is partly a function of the logic of repeated games. Theimportance of payoffs achievable through cooperation in future gamesleads those who expect to interact in them to be less selfish thantemptation would otherwise encourage in present games. The fact thatsuch equilibria become more stable through learning gives friends thelogical character of built-up investments, which most people takegreat pleasure in sentimentalizing. Furthermore, cultivating sharedinterests and sentiments provides networks of focal points aroundwhich coordination can be increasingly facilitated.</p> <h2><a name="Com">5. Commitment</a></h2> <p>In some games, a player can improve her outcome by taking an actionthat makes it impossible for her to take what would be her bestaction in the corresponding simultaneous-move game. Such actions arereferred to as <em>commitments</em>, and they can serve asalternatives to external enforcement in games which would otherwisesettle on Pareto-inefficient equilibria.</p> <p>Consider the following hypothetical example (which is <em>not</em> aPD). Suppose you own a piece of land adjacent to mine, and I'd like tobuy it so as to expand my lot. Unfortunately, you don't want to sellat the price I'm willing to pay. If we move simultaneously—youpost a selling price and I independently give my agent an askingprice—there will be no sale. So I might try to change yourincentives by playing an opening move in which I announce that I'llbuild a putrid-smelling sewage disposal plant on my land beside yoursunless you sell, thereby inducing you to lower your price. I've nowturned this into a sequential-move game. However, this move so farchanges nothing. If you refuse to sell in the face of my threat, it isthen not in my interest to carry it out, because in damaging you Ialso damage myself. Since you know this you should ignore mythreat. My threat is <em>incredible</em>, a case of cheap talk.</p> <p>However, I could make my threat credible by <em>committing</em>myself. For example, I could sign a contract with some farmerspromising to supply them with treated sewage (fertilizer) from myplant, but including an escape clause in the contract releasing mefrom my obligation only if I can double my lot size and so put it tosome other use. Now my threat is credible: if you don't sell, I'mcommitted to building the sewage plant. Since you know this, you nowhave an incentive to sell me your land in order to escape itsruination.</p> <p>This sort of case exposes one of many fundamental differences betweenthe logic of non-parametric and parametric maximization. In parametricsituations, an agent can never be made worse off by having moreoptions. (Even if a new option is worse than the options with whichshe began, she can just ignore it.) But where circumstances arenon-parametric, one agent's strategy can be influenced in another'sfavour if options are visibly restricted. Cortez's burning of hisboats (see <a href="#Mot">Section 1</a>) is, of course, an instance of this, one which serves to make theusual metaphor literal.</p> <p>Another example will illustrate this, as well as the applicability ofprinciples across game-types. Here we will build an imaginarysituation that is not a PD—since only one player has anincentive to defect—but which is a social dilemma insofar as itsNE in the absence of commitment is Pareto-inferior to an outcome thatis achievable <em>with</em> a commitment device. Suppose that two ofus wish to poach a rare antelope from a national park in order to sellthe trophy. One of us must flush the animal down towards the secondperson, who waits in a blind to shoot it and load it onto a truck. Youpromise, of course, to share the proceeds with me. However, yourpromise is not credible. Once you've got the buck, you have no reasonnot to drive it away and pocket the full value from it. After all, Ican't very well complain to the police without getting myself arrestedtoo. But now suppose I add the following opening move to thegame. Before our hunt, I rig out the truck with an alarm that can beturned off only by punching in a code. Only I know the code. If youtry to drive off without me, the alarm will sound and we'll both getcaught. You, knowing this, now have an incentive to wait for me. Whatis crucial to notice here is that you <em>prefer</em> that I rig upthe alarm, since this makes your promise to give me my sharecredible. If I don't do this, leaving your promise<em>in</em>credible, we'll be unable to agree to try the crime in thefirst place, and both of us will lose our shot at the profit fromselling the trophy. Thus, you benefit from my preventing you fromdoing what's optimal for you in a subgame.</p> <p>We may now combine our analysis of PDs and commitment devices indiscussion of the application that first made game theory famousoutside of the academic community. The nuclear stand-off between thesuperpowers during the Cold War was exhaustively studied by the firstgeneration of game theorists, many of whom worked for the US military.(See <a href="#Pou92">Poundstone 1992</a> for historical details.) Boththe USA and the USSR maintained the following policy. If one sidelaunched a first strike, the other threatened to answer with adevastating counter-strike. This pair of reciprocal strategies, whichby the late 1960s would effectively have meant blowing up the world,was known as ‘Mutually Assured Destruction’, or‘MAD’. Game theorists objected that MAD was mad, becauseit set up a PD as a result of the fact that the reciprocal threatswere incredible. The reasoning behind this diagnosis went asfollows. Suppose the USSR launches a first strike against the USA. Atthat point, the American President finds his country alreadydestroyed. He doesn't bring it back to life by now blowing up theworld, so he has no incentive to carry out his original threat toretaliate, which has now manifestly failed to achieve its point. Sincethe Russians can anticipate this, they should ignore the threat toretaliate and strike first. Of course, the Americans are in an exactlysymmetric position, so they too should strike first. Each power willrecognize this incentive on the part of the other, and so willanticipate an attack if they don't rush to preempt it. What we shouldtherefore expect, because it is the only NE of the game, is a racebetween the two powers to be the first to attack.</p> <p>This game-theoretic analysis caused genuine consternation and fear onboth sides during the Cold War, and is reputed to have produced somestriking attempts at setting up strategic commitment devices. Someanecdotes, for example, allege that President Nixon had the CIA try toconvince the Russians that he was insane or frequently drunk, so thatthey'd believe that he'd launch a retaliatory strike even when it wasno longer in his interest to do so. Similarly, the Soviet KGB isclaimed to have fabricated medical reports exaggerating Brezhnev'ssenility with the same end in mind. Ultimately, the strategic symmetrythat concerned the Pentagon's analysts was complicated and perhapsbroken by changes in American missile deployment tactics. They equippeda worldwide fleet of submarines with enough missiles to destroy theUSSR. This made the reliability of their communications network lessstraightforward, and in so doing introduced an element ofstrategically relevant uncertainty. The President probably could beless sure to be able to reach the submarines and cancel their ordersto attack if any Soviet missile crossed the radar trigger line inNorthern Canada. Of course, the value of this in breaking symmetrydepended on the Russians being aware of the potential problem. InStanley Kubrick's classic film <em>Dr. Strangelove</em>, the world isdestroyed by accident because the Russians build a doomsday machinethat will automatically trigger a retaliatory strike regardless oftheir leadership's resolve to follow through on the implicit MADthreat <em>but then keep it a secret</em>. As a result, when anunequivocally mad American colonel launches missiles at Russia on hisown accord, and the American President tries to convince his Sovietcounterpart that the attack was unintended, the Russian Premiersheepishly tells him about the secret doomsday machine. Now the twoleaders can do nothing but watch in dismay as the world is blown updue to a game-theoretic mistake.</p> <p>This example of the Cold War standoff, while famous and ofconsiderable importance in the history of game theory and its popularreception, relied at the time on analyses that weren't verysubtle. The military game theorists were almost certainly mistaken tothe extent that they modeled the Cold War as a one-shot PD in thefirst place. For one thing, the nuclear balancing game was enmeshed inlarger global power games of great complexity. For another, it is farfrom clear that, for either superpower, annihilating the other whileavoiding self-annihilation was in fact the highest-ranked outcome. Ifit wasn't, in either or both cases, then the game wasn't a PD. A wisecynic might suggest that the operations researchers on both sides wereplaying a cunning strategy in a game over funding, one that involvedthem cooperating with one another in order to convince theirpoliticians to allocate more resources to weapons.</p> <p>In more mundane circumstances, most people exploit a ubiquitouscommitment device that Adam Smith long ago made the centerpiece of histheory of social order: the value to people of theirown <em>reputations</em>. Even if I am secretly stingy, I may wishothers to think me generous by tipping in restaurants, includingrestaurants in which I never intend to eat again. The more I do thissort of thing, the more I invest in a valuable reputation which Icould badly damage through a single act of obvious, and observed,mean-ness. Thus my hard-earned reputation for generosity functions asa commitment mechanism in specific games, itself enforcing continuedre-investment. There is a good deal of evidence that the thehyper-sociality of humans is supported by evolved biologicaldispositions (found in most but not all people) to suffer emotionallyfrom negative gossip and the fear of it. People are also naturallydisposed to <em>enjoy</em> gossiping, which means that punishingothers by spreading the news when their commitment devices fail is aform of social policing they don't find costly and happily take up. Anice feature of this form of punishment is that it can, unlike (say)hitting people with sticks, be withdrawn without leaving long-termdamage to the punishee. This is a happy property of a device that hasas its point the maintenance of incentives to contribute to jointsocial projects; collaboration is generally more fruitful withteam-mates whose bones aren't broken. Thus forgiveness conventionsalso play a strategic role in this extremely elegant commitmentmechanism that natural selection built for us. Finally, <em>norms</em>are culturally evolved mutual expectations in a group of people (or,for that matter, elephants or dolphins or monkeys) that have thefurther property that individuals who violate them maypunish <em>themselves</em> by feeling guilt or shame. Thus they mayoften take cooperative actions against their narrow self-interest evenwhen no one else is paying attention. Religious stories, or bogusphilosophical ones involving Kantian 'rationality', are especiallylikely to be told in explanation of norms because the underlyinggame-theoretic basis doesn't occur to people.</p> <p>Though the so-called ‘moral emotions’are extremely usefulfor maintaining commitment, they are not necessary for it. Largerhuman institutions are, famously, highly morally obtuse; however,commitment is typically crucial to their functional logic. Forexample, a government tempted to negotiate with terrorists to securethe release of hostages on a particular occasion may commit to a‘line in the sand’ strategy for the sake of maintaining areputation for toughness intended to reduce terrorists' incentives tolaunch future attacks. A different sort of example is provided byQantas Airlines of Australia. Qantas has never suffered an accident,and makes much of this in its advertising. This means that its planesprobably <em>are</em> safer than average even if the initial advantagewas merely a bit of statistical good fortune, because the value of itsability to claim a perfect record rises the longer it lasts, and sogives the airline continuous incentives to incur greater costs insafety assurance.</p> <p>Certain conditions must hold if reputation effects are to underwritecommitment. First, the game must be repeated. Reputation has nostrategic value in a one-shot game. Second, the value of thereputation must be greater to its cultivator than the value to him ofsacrificing it in <em>any</em> particular round of the repeatedgame. Thus players may establish commitment by reducing the value ofeach round so that the temptation to defect in any round never getshigh enough to constitute a hard-to-resist temptation. For example,parties to a contract may exchange their obligations in smallincrements to reduce incentives on both sides to renege. Thus buildersin construction projects may be paid in weekly or monthlyinstallments. Similarly, the International Monetary Fund oftendispenses loans to governments in small tranches, thereby reducinggovernments' incentives to violate loan conditions once the money isin hand; and governments may actually prefer such arrangements inorder to remove domestic political pressure for non-compliant use ofthe money. Of course, we are all familiar with cases in which thepayoff from a defection in a current round becomes too great relativeto the longer-run value of reputation to future cooperation, and weawake to find that the society treasurer has absconded overnight withthe funds. Commitment through concern for reputation is the cement ofsociety, but any such natural bonding agent will be far from perfectlyeffective.</p> <h2><a name="Evo">6. Evolutionary Game Theory</a></h2> <p> <a href="#Gin00">Gintis (2000</a>, <a href="#Gin09">2009</a>) feels justified in stating that “game theory is auniversal language for the unification of the behavioral sciences.”This may seem to many as if it must be a considerable rhetoricalexaggeration, but in my opinion it is entirely plausible. There aregood examples of such unifying work. Binmore(<a href="#Bin98">1998</a>, <a href="#Bin05a">2005a</a>) models social history as a series of convergences on increasinglyefficient equilibria in commonly encountered transaction games,interrupted by episodes in which some people try to shift to newequilibria by moving off stable equilibrium paths, resulting inperiodic catastrophes. (Stalin, for example, tried to shift hissociety to a set of equilibria in which people cared more about thefuture industrial, military and political power of their state thanthey cared about their own lives. He was not successful; however, hisefforts certainly created a situation in which, for a few decades,many Soviet people attached far less importance to <em>otherpeople's</em> lives than usual.) Furthermore, applications of gametheory to behavioral topics extend well beyond the politicalarena. In <a href="#Repeat">Section 4</a>, for example, we consideredLewis's recognition that each human language amounts to a network ofNash equilibria in coordination games around conveyance ofinformation.</p> <p>Given his work's vintage, Lewis restricted his attention to staticgame theory, in which agents are modeled asdeliberately <em>choosing</em> strategies given exogenously fixedutility-functions. As a result of this restriction, his accountinvited some philosophers to pursue a misguided quest for a generalanalytic theory of the rationality of conventions(<a href="#Bic08">Bickhard 2008</a>). Though Ken Binmore hascriticized this focus repeatedly through a career's worth ofcontributions (see the references for aselection), <a href="#Gin09">Gintis (2009)</a> has recently isolatedthe underlying problem with particular clarity and tenacity. NE andSPE are <em>brittle</em> solution concepts when applied to naturallyevolved computational mechanisms like animal (including human)brains. As we saw in <a href="#Uncer">Section 3</a> above, incoordination (and other) games with multiple NE, what it iseconomically rational for a player to do is highly sensitive to thelearning states of other players. In general, when players findthemselves in games where they do not have strictly dominantstrategies, they only have uncomplicated incentives to play NE or SPEstrategies to the extent that other players can be expected tofind <em>their</em> NE or SPE strategies. Can a <em>general</em>theory of strategic rationality, of the sort that philosophers havesought, be reasonably expected to cover the resulting contingencies?Resort to Bayesian reasoning principles, as we reviewedin <a href="#Beliefs">Section 3.1</a>, is the standard way of tryingto incorporate such uncertainty into theories of rational, strategicdecision. However, as <a href="#Bin09">Binmore (2009)</a> shows withbeautiful clarity in a recent book, Bayesian principles are onlyplausible <em>as principles of rationality itself</em> in so-called‘small worlds’, that is, environments in whichdistributions of risk are quantified in a set of known and enumerableparameters, as in the solution our river crossing gamefrom <a href="#Uncer">Section 3</a>. In large worlds, where utilityfunctions, strategy sets and informational structure are difficult toestimate and subject to change by contingent exogenous influences, theidea that Bayes's rule tells players how to ‘be rational’is quite implausible. But then why should we expect players to chooseNE or SPE or sequential-equilibrium strategies?</p> <p>As <a href="#Bin09">Binmore (2009)</a> and <a href="#Gin09">Gintis (2009)</a> both stress, if game theory is to be used to model actual,natural behavior and its history, outside of the small-world settingson which microeconomists (but not macroeconomists or politicalscientists or sociologists or philosophers of science) mainly traffic,then we need some account of what is attractive about equilibria ingames even when no analysis can identify them by taming alluncertainty in such a way that it can be represented as pure risk. Tomake reference again to Lewis's topic, when human language developedthere was no external referee to care about and arrange forPareto-efficiency by providing focal points for coordination. Yetsomehow people agreed, within linguistic communities, to use roughlythe same words and constructions to say similar things. It seemsunlikely that any explicit, deliberate strategizing on anyone's partplayed a role in these processes. Nevertheless, game theory has turnedout to furnish the essential concepts for understanding stabilizationof languages. This is a striking point of support for Gintis'soptimism about the reach of game theory. To understand it, we mustextend our attention to <em>evolutionary</em> games.</p> <p>Game theory has been fruitfully applied in evolutionary biology,where species and/or genes are treated as players, since pioneeringwork by <a href="#May82">Maynard Smith (1982)</a> and his collaborators. Evolutionary (or <em>dynamic</em>) game theorynow constitutes a significant new mathematical extension applicable tomany settings apart from the biological. <a href="#Sky96">Skyrms (1996)</a>uses evolutionary game theory to try to answer questions Lewis couldnot even ask, about the conditions under which language, concepts ofjustice, the notion of private property, and other non-designed,general phenomena of interest to philosophers would be likely toarise. What is novel about evolutionary game theory is that moves arenot chosen by economically rational agents. Instead, agents aretypically hard-wired with particular strategies, and success for astrategy is defined in terms of the number of copies of itself that itwill leave to play in the games of succeeding generations, given apopulation in which other strategies with which it acts aredistributed at particular frequencies. In this kind of problemsetting, the strategies themselves are the players, and individualswho play these strategies are their mere executors who receive theimmediate-run costs and benefits associated with outcomes.</p> <p>The discussion here will closely follow Skyrms's. We begin byintroducing <em>the replicator dynamics</em>. Consider first hownatural selection works to change lineages of animals, modifying,creating and destroying species. The basic mechanism is<em>differential reproduction</em>. Any animal with <em>heritable</em>features that increase its <em>expected number of offspring</em> in agiven environment will tend to leave more offspring than others solong as the environment remains relatively stable. These offspringwill be more likely to inherit the features in question. Therefore,the proportion of these features in the population will graduallyincrease as generations pass. Some of these features may <em>go tofixation</em>, that is, eventually take over the entire population(until the environment changes).</p> <p>How does game theory enter into this? Often, one of the most importantaspects of an organism's environment will be the behaviouraltendencies of other organisms. We can think of each lineage as‘trying’ to maximize its reproductive fitness (= expectednumber of grandchildren) through finding strategies that are optimalgiven the strategies of other lineages. So evolutionary theory isanother domain of application for non-parametric analysis.</p> <p>In evolutionary game theory, we no longer think of individuals as choosingstrategies as they move from one game to another. This is because ourinterests are different. We're now concerned less with finding theequilibria of single games than with discovering which equilibria arestable, and how they will change over time. So we now model <em>thestrategies themselves</em> as playing against each other. Onestrategy is ‘better’ than another if it is likely to leavemore copies of itself in the next generation, when the game will beplayed again. We study the changes in distribution of strategies inthe population as the sequence of games unfolds.</p> <p>For dynamic game theory, we introduce a new equilibrium concept, dueto <a href="#May82">Maynard Smith (1982)</a>. A set of strategies, in some particular proportion (e.g., 1/3:2/3,1/2:1/2, 1/9:8/9, 1/3:1/3:1/6:1/6—always summing to 1) is at an<em>ESS</em> (Evolutionary Stable Strategy) equilibrium just in case(1) no individual playing one strategy could improve its reproductivefitness by switching to one of the other strategies in the proportion,and (2) no mutant playing a different strategy altogether couldestablish itself (‘invade’) in the population.</p> <p>The principles of evolutionary game theory are best explained throughexamples. Skyrms begins by investigating the conditions under which asense of justice—understood as a disposition to view equaldivisions of resources as fair unless efficiency considerationssuggest otherwise in special cases—might arise. He asks us toconsider a population in which individuals regularly meet each otherand must bargain over resources. Begin with three types ofindividuals:</p> <ol type="a"> <li><em>Fairmen</em> always demand exactly half the resource.</li> <li><em>Greedies</em> always demand more than half the resource. When agreedy encounters another greedy, they waste the resource in fightingover it.</li> <li><em>Modests</em> always demand less than half the resource. When amodest encounters another modest, they take less than all of theavailable resource and waste some.</li> </ol> <p>Each <em>single</em> encounter where the total demands sum to 100% is aNE of that individual game. Similarly, there can be many dynamicequilibria. Suppose that Greedies demand 2/3 of the resource andModests demand 1/3. Then the following two proportions are ESS's: </p> <ol type="i"> <li>Half the population is greedy and half is modest. We can calculatethe average payoff here. Modest gets 1/3 of the resource in everyencounter. Greedy gets 2/3 when she meets Modest, but nothing when shemeets another Greedy. So her average payoff is also 1/3. This is anESS because Fairman can't invade. When Fairman meets Modest he gets1/2. But when Fairman meets Greedy he gets nothing. So his averagepayoff is only 1/4. No Modest has an incentive to change strategies,and neither does any Greedy. A mutant Fairman arising in thepopulation would do worst of all, and so selection will not encouragethe propagation of any such mutants.</li> <li>All players are Fairmen. Everyone always gets half the resource,and no one can do better by switching to another strategy. Greediesentering this population encounter Fairmen and get an average payoffof 0. Modests get 1/3 as before, but this is less than Fairman'spayoff of 1/2.</li> </ol> <p>Notice that equilibrium (i) is inefficient, since the average payoffacross the whole population is smaller. However, just as inefficientoutcomes can be NE of static games, so they can be ESS's of dynamicones. </p> <p>We refer to equilibria in which more than one strategy occurs as<em>polymorphisms</em>. In general, in Skyrms's game, any polymorphismin which Greedy demands <em>x</em> and Modest demands1−<em>x</em> is an ESS. The question that interests the studentof justice concerns the relative likelihood with which these differentequilibria arise.</p> <p>This depends entirely on the proportions of strategies in the originalpopulation state. If the population begins with more than one Fairman,then there is some probability that Fairmen will encounter each other,and get the highest possible average payoff. Modests by themselves donot inhibit the spread of Fairmen; only Greedies do. But Greediesthemselves depend on having Modests around in order to be viable. Sothe more Fairmen there are in the population relative to<em>pairs</em> of Greedies and Modests, the better Fairmen do onaverage. This implies a threshold effect. If the proportion of Fairmendrops below 33%, then the tendency will be for them to fall toextinction because they don't meet each other often enough. If thepopulation of Fairmen rises above 33%, then the tendency will be forthem to rise to fixation because their extra gains when they meet eachother compensates for their losses when they meet Greedies. You cansee this by noticing that when each strategy is used by 33% of thepopulation, all have an expected average payoff of 1/3. Therefore, anyrise above this threshold on the part of Fairmen will tend to pushthem towards fixation.</p> <p>This result shows that and how, given certain relatively generalconditions, justice as we have defined it <em>can</em> arisedynamically. The news for the fans of justice gets more cheerful stillif we introduce <em>correlated play</em>.</p> <p>The model we just considered assumes that strategies are not<em>correlated</em>, that is, that the probability with which everystrategy meets every other strategy is a simple function of theirrelative frequencies in the population. We now examine what happens inour dynamic resource-division game when we introduce correlation.Suppose that Fairmen have a slight ability to distinguish and seek outother Fairmen as interaction partners. In that case, Fairmen on averagedo better, and this must have the effect of lowering their thresholdfor going to fixation.</p> <p>An evolutionary game modeler studies the effects of correlation and otherparametric constraints by means of running large computer simulationsin which the strategies compete with one another, round after round, inthe virtual environment. The starting proportions of strategies, andany chosen degree of correlation, can simply be set in the programme.One can then watch its dynamics unfold over time, and measure theproportion of time it stays in any one equilibrium. These proportionsare represented by the relative sizes of the <em>basins ofattraction</em> for different possible equilibria. Equilibria areattractor points in a dynamic space; a basin of attraction for eachsuch point is then the set of points in the space from which thepopulation will converge to the equilibrium in question.</p> <p>In introducing correlation into his model, Skyrms first sets thedegree of correlation at a very small .1. This causes the basin ofattraction for equilibrium (i) to shrink by half. When the degree ofcorrelation is set to .2, the polymorphic basin reduces to the pointat which the population starts in the polymorphism. Thus very smallincreases in correlation produce large proportionate increases in thestability of the equilibrium where everyone plays Fairman. A smallamount of correlation is a reasonable assumption in most populations,given that neighbours tend to interact with one another and to mimicone another (either genetically or because of tendencies todeliberately copy each other), and because genetically and culturally similar animalsare more likely to live in common environments. Thus if justice canarise at all it will tend to be dominant and stable.</p> <p>Much of political philosophy consists in attempts to produce deductivenormative arguments intended to convince an unjust agent that she hasreasons to act justly. Skyrms's analysis suggests a quite differentapproach. Fairman will do best of all in the dynamic game if he takesactive steps to preserve correlation. Therefore, there is evolutionarypressure for both <em>moral approval of justice</em> and <em>justinstitutions</em> to arise. Most people may think that 50–50 splitsare ‘fair’, and worth maintaining by moral andinstitutional reward and sanction, <em>because</em> we are theproducts of a dynamic game that promoted our tendency to think thisway.</p> <p>The topic that has received most attention from evolutionary gametheorists is <em>altruism</em>, defined as any behaviour by anorganism that decreases its own expected fitness in a singleinteraction but increases that of the other interactor. It is commonin nature. How can it arise, however, given Darwinian competition?</p> <p>Skyrms studies this question using the dynamic Prisoner's Dilemma ashis example. This is simply a series of PD games played in apopulation, some of whose members are defectors and some of whom arecooperators. Payoffs, as always in dynamic games, are measured interms of expected numbers of copies of each strategy in futuregenerations.</p> <p>Let <strong>U</strong>(<em>A</em>) be the average fitness of strategy<em>A</em> in the population. Let <strong>U</strong> be the averagefitness of the whole population. Then the proportion of strategy<em>A</em> in the next generation is just the ratio<strong>U</strong>(<em>A</em>)/<strong>U</strong>. So if <em>A</em>has greater fitness than the population average <em>A</em>increases. If <em>A</em> has lower fitness than the population averagethen <em>A</em> decreases.</p> <p>In the dynamic PD where interaction is random (i.e., there's nocorrelation), defectors do better than the population average as longas there are cooperators around. This follows from the fact that, as wesaw in <a href="#PD">Section 2.4</a>, defection is always the dominantstrategy in a single game. 100% defection is therefore the ESS in thedynamic game without correlation, corresponding to the NE in theone-shot static PD.</p> <p>However, introducing the possibility of correlation radically changesthe picture. We now need to compute the average fitness of a strategy<em>given its probability of meeting each other possiblestrategy</em>. In the evolutionary PD, cooperators whose probability ofmeeting other cooperators is high do better than defectors whoseprobability of meeting other defectors is high. Correlation thusfavours cooperation.</p> <p>In order to be able to say something more precise about thisrelationship between correlation and cooperation (and in order to beable to relate evolutionary game theory to issues in decision theory,a matter falling outside the scope of this article), Skyrms introducesa new technical concept. He calls a strategy <em>adaptivelyratifiable</em> if there is a region around its fixation point in thedynamic space such that from anywhere within that region it will go tofixation. In the dynamic PD, both defection and cooperation areadaptively ratifiable. The relative sizes of basins of attraction arehighly sensitive to the particular mechanisms by which correlation isachieved. To illustrate this point, Skyrms builds severalexamples.</p> <p>One of Skyrms's models introduces correlation by means of a<em>filter</em> on pairing for interaction. Suppose that in round 1 ofa dynamic PD individuals inspect each other and interact, or not,depending on what they find. In the second and subsequent rounds, allindividuals who didn't pair in round 1 are randomly paired. In thisgame, the basin of attraction for defection is large <em>unless</em>there is a high proportion of cooperators in round one. In this case,defectors fail to pair in round 1, then get paired mostly with eachother in round 2 and drive each other to extinction. A model which ismore interesting, because its mechanism is less artificial, does notallow individuals to choose their partners, but requires them tointeract with those closest to them. Because of genetic relatedness(or cultural learning by copying) individuals are more likely toresemble their neighbours than not. If this (finite) population isarrayed along one dimension (i.e., along a line), and both cooperatorsand defectors are introduced into positions along it at random, thenwe get the following dynamics. Isolated cooperators have lowerexpected fitness than the surrounding defectors and are driven locallyto extinction. Members of groups of two cooperators have a 50%probability of interacting with each other, and a 50% probability ofeach interacting with a defector. As a result, their average expectedfitness remains smaller than that of their neighbouring defectors, andthey too face probable extinction. Groups of three cooperators form anunstable point from which both extinction and expansion are equallylikely. However, in groups of four or more cooperators at least oneencounter of a cooperator with a cooperator sufficient to at leastreplace the original group is guaranteed. Under this circumstance, thecooperators as a group do better than the surrounding defectors andincrease at their expense. Eventually cooperators go <em>almost</em>to fixation—but nor quite. Single defectors on the periphery ofthe population prey on the cooperators at the ends and survive aslittle ‘criminal communities’. We thus see that altruismcan not only be maintained by the dynamics of evolutionary games, but,with correlation, can even spread and colonize originallynon-altruistic populations.</p> <p>Darwinian dynamics thus offers qualified good news for cooperation.Notice, however, that this holds only so long as individuals are stuckwith their natural or cultural programming and can't re-evaluate theirutilities for themselves. If our agents get too smart and flexible,they may notice that they're in PDs and would each be best offdefecting. In that case, they'll eventually drive themselves toextinction — unless they develop stable, and effective, moralnorms that work to reinforce cooperation. But, of course, these arejust what we would expect to evolve in populations of animals whoseaverage fitness levels are closely linked to their capacities forsuccessful social cooperation. Even given this, these populations willgo extinct unless they care about future generations for somereason. But there's no rational reason as to why agents<em>should</em> care about future generations if each new generationwholly replaces the preceding one at each change of cohorts. For thisreason, economists use ‘overlapping generations’ modelswhen modeling distribution games. Individuals in generation 1 who willlast until generation 5 save resources for the generation 3individuals with whom they'll want to cooperate; and by generation 3the new individuals care about generation 6; and so on.</p> <p><a href="#Gin09">Gintis (2009)</a> argues that when we set out to useevolutionary game theory to unify the behavioral sciences, we begin byusing it to unify game theory itself. We have pointed out at severalearlier points in the present article that NE and SPE are problematicsolution concepts in many applications where explicit institutionalrules are missing because agents only have incentives to play NE orSPE to the extent that they are confident that other agents will dolikewise. To the extent that agents do not have such confidence— and this, by the way, is itself an insight due to game theory— what should be predicted is general disorder and socialconfusion. Gintis shows in detail how the key to this problem is theexistence of what he calls a ‘choreographer’. By thismeans some exogenous element that informs agents about whichequilibrium strategies they should expect others to play. As discussedin <a href="#Com">Section 5</a>, cultural norms are probably the mostimportant choreographers for people. Interesting utility functionsthat incorporate norms of the relevant sort are extensively studiedin <a href="#Bic06">Bicchieri (2006)</a>. In this context, Gintisdemonstrates a further unifying element of great importance: if agentsattach positive utility to following the choreographer's suggestions(that is, to being strategically correlated with others for the sheersake of it), then wherever competing potential payoffs do notoverwhelm this incentive, agents can also be expected to consistentlyestimate Bayesian priors, and thus arrive at equilibria-in-beliefs, asdiscussed in <a href="#Beliefs">Section 3.1</a>, in games of imperfectinformation.</p> <p>In light of this, when we wonder about the value of game-theoreticmodels in application to human behavior outside of well-structuredmarkets, much hinges on what we take to be plausible and empiricallyvalidated sources of people's incentives to be coordinated with oneanother. This has been a subject of extensive recent debate, which wewill review in <a href="#Human">Section 7.3</a> below.</p> <h2><a name="Behav">7. Game Theory and Behavioral Evidence</a></h2> <p>In earlier sections, we reviewed some problems that arise fromtreating classical (non-evolutionary) game theory as a normativetheory that tells people what they ought to do if they wish to berational in strategic situations. The difficulty, as we saw, is thatthere seems to be no one solution concept we can unequivocallyrecommend for all situations, particularly where agents have privateinformation. However, in the previous section we showed how appeal toevolutionary foundations sheds light on conditions under which utilityfunctions that have been explicitly worked out can plausibly beapplied to groups of people, leading to game-theoretic models withplausible and stable solutions. So far, however, we have not reviewedany actual empirical evidence from behavioral observations orexperiments. Has game theory indeed helped empirical researchers makenew discoveries about behavior (human or otherwise)? If so, what ingeneral has the content of these discoveries been?</p> <p>In addressing these questions, an immediate epistemological issueconfronts us. There is no way of applying game theory ‘all byitself’, independently of other modelling technologies. Usingterminology standard in the philosophy of science, one can test agame-theoretic model of a phenomenon only in tandem with‘auxiliary assumptions’ about the phenomenon inquestion. At least, this follows if one is strict about treating gametheory purely as mathematics, with no empirical content of its own. Inone sense, a theory with no empirical content is never open to testingat all; one can only worry about whether the axioms on which thetheory is based are mutually consistent. A mathematical theory cannevertheless be evaluated with respect to empirical<em>usefulness</em>. One kind of philosophical criticism that hassometimes been made of game theory, interpreted as a mathematical toolfor modelling behavioral phenomena, is that its application always orusually requires resort to false, misleading or badly simplisticassumptions about those phenomena. We would expect this criticism tohave different degrees of force in different contexts of application,as the auxiliary assumptions vary.</p> <p>So matters turn out. There is no interesting domain in whichapplications of game theory have been completelyuncontroversial. However, there has been generally easier consensus onhow to use game theory (both classical and evolutionary) to understandnon-human animal behavior than on how to deploy it for explanation andprediction of the strategic activities of people. Let us first brieflyconsider philosophical and methodological issues that have arisenaround application of game theory in non-human biology, beforedevoting fuller attention to game-theoretic social science.</p> <p>The least controversial game-theoretic modelling has applied theclassical form of the theory to consideration of strategies by whichnon-human animals seek to acquire the basic resource relevant to theirevolutionary tournament: opportunities to produce offspring that arethemselves likely to reproduce. In order to thereby maximize theirexpected fitness, animals must find optimal trade-offs among variousintermediate goods, such as nutrition, security from predation andability to out-compete rivals for mates. Efficient trade-off pointsamong these goods can often be estimated for particular species inparticular environmental circumstances, and, on the basis of theseestimations, both parametric and non-parametric equilibria can bederived. Models of this sort have an impressive track record inpredicting and explaining independent empirical data on such strategicphenomena as competitive foraging, mate selection, nepotism, siblingrivalry,herding, collective anti-predator vigilance and signaling,reciprocal grooming, and interspecific mutuality (symbiosis). (Forexamples see <a href="#Krebs84">Krebs and Davies 1984</a>, <a href="#Bell91">Bell 1991</a>, <a href="#Dug98">Dugatkin and Reeve 1998</a>, <a href="#Duk98">Dukas 1998</a>, and <a href="#Noe01">Noe, van Hoof and Hammerstein 2001</a>.) On the other hand, as <a href="#Ham03">Hammerstein (2003)</a>observes, reciprocity, and its exploitation and metaexploitation, aremuch more rarely seen in social non-human animals than game-theoreticmodeling would lead us to anticipate. One explanation for thissuggested by Hammerstein is that non-human animals typically have lessability to restrict their interaction partners than do people. Ourdiscussion in the previous section of the importance of correlationfor stabilizing game solutions lends theoretical support to thissuggestion.</p> <p>Why has classical game theory helped to predict non-human animalbehavior more straightforwardly than it has done most human behavior?The answer is presumed to lie in different levels of complication amongst therelationships between auxiliary assumptions and phenomena. <a href="#Ross05a">Ross (2005a)</a> offers the following account. Utility-maximization andfitness-maximization problems are the domain of economics. Economictheory identifies the maximizing units — economic agents — withunchanging preference fields. Identification of whole biologicalindividuals with such agents is more plausible the less cognitivelysophisticated the organism. Thus insects (for example) are tailor-madefor easy application of Revealed Preference Theory (see <a href="#Util">Section 2.1</a>). As nervous systems become more complex, however, we encounter animalsthat learn. Learning can cause a sufficient degree of permanentmodification in an animal's behavioral patterns that we can preservethe identification of the biological individual with a single agentacross the modification only at the cost of explanatory emptiness(because assignments of utility functions become increasingly adhoc). Furthermore, increasing complexity confounds simple modeling ona second dimension: cognitively sophisticated animals not only changetheir preferences over time, but are governed by distributed controlprocesses that make them sites of competition among <em>internal</em>agents (<a href="#Sch80">Schelling 1980</a>; <a href="#Ain92">Ainslie 1992</a>, <a href="#Ain01">Ainslie 2001</a>). Thus they are notstraightforward economic agents even <em>at</em> a time. In settingout to model the behavior of people using any part of economic theory,including game theory, we must recognize that the relationship betweenany given person and an economic agent we construct for modelingpurposes will always be more complicated than simple identity.</p> <p>There is of course no sudden crossing point at which an animalbecomes too cognitively sophisticated to be modeled as a single economic agent,and for all animals (including humans) there are contexts in which wecan usefully ignore the synchronic dimension of complexity. However,we encounter a phase shift in modeling dynamics when we turn fromasocial animals to non-eusocial social ones. (That is, animals thatare social but that don't, like ants, bees, wasps, termites and nakedmole rats, achieve cooperation thanks to fundamental changes in theirpopulation genetics that make individuals within groups into nearclones. Main known instances are parrots, corvids, bats, rats,canines, hyenas, pigs, weasels, elephants, hyraxes, cetacians, andprimates.) In their cases stabilization of internal control dynamicsis partly located <em>outside</em> the individuals, at the level ofgroup dynamics. With these creatures, modeling an individual as aneconomic agent, with a single comprehensive utility function, is a drasticidealization, which can only be done with the greatest methodologicalcaution and attention to specific contextual factors relevant to theparticular modeling exercise. Applications of game theory here canonly be empirically adequate to the extent that the economic modelingis empirically adequate.</p> <p><em>H. sapiens</em> is the extreme case inthis respect. Individual humans are socially controlled to a degreeunknown in any other non-eusocial species. At the same time, theirgreat cognitive plasticity allows them to vary significantly betweencultures. People are thus the least straightforward economic agentsamong all organisms. (It might thus be thought ironic that they weretaken, originally and for many years, to be the exemplary instances ofeconomic agency.) We will consider the implications of this forapplications of game theory below.</p> <p>First, however, comments are in order concerning the empiricaladequacy of <em>evolutionary</em> game theory to explain and predictdistributions of strategic dispositions in populations of agents. Suchmodeling is applied both to animals as products of natural selection(<a href="#Hof98">Hofbauer and Sigmund 1998</a>), and to non-eusocialsocial animals (but especially humans) as products of culturalselection (<a href="#Young98">Young 1998</a>). There are two mainkinds of auxiliary assumptions one must justify, relative to aparticular instance at hand, in constructing such applications. First,one must have grounds for confidence that the dispositions one seeksto explain are (either biological or cultural, as the case maybe) <em>adaptations</em> — that is, dispositions that wereselected and are maintained because of the way in which they promotetheir own fitness or the fitness of the wider system, rather thanbeing accidents or structurally inevitable byproducts of otheradaptations. (See <a href="#Den95">Dennett 1995</a> for a generaldiscussion of this issue.) Second, one must be able to set themodeling enterprise in the context of a justified set of assumptionsabout interrelationships among nested evolutionary processes ondifferent time scales. (For example, in the case of a species withcultural dynamics, how does slow genetic evolution constrain fastcultural evolution? How does cultural evolution feed back into geneticevolution, if it feeds back at all? For a supremely lucid discussionof these issues, see <a href="#Ste03">Sterelny 2003</a>.) Conflictingviews over which such assumptions should be made about human evolutionare the basis for lively current disputes in the evolutionarygame-theoretic modeling of human behavioral dispositions andinstitutions. This is where issues in evolutionary game theory meetissues in the booming field of <em>behavioral-experimental</em> gametheory. I will therefore first describe the second field beforeclosing the present article by giving a sense of the controversiesjust alluded to, which now constitute the liveliest domain ofphilosophical argument in the foundations of game theory and itsapplications.</p> <h3><a name="Lab">7.1 Game Theory in the Laboratory</a></h3> <p> Economists have been testing theories by running laboratoryexperiments with human and other animal subjects since pioneering workby <a href="#Thu31">Thurstone (1931)</a>. In recent decades, the volume of such work has become positivelygigantic. The vast majority of it sets subjects in microeconomicproblem environments that are imperfectly competitive. Since this isprecisely the condition in which microeconomics collapses into gametheory, most experimental economics has been experimental gametheory. It is thus difficult to distinguish between experimentallymotivated questions about the empirical adequacy of microeconomictheory and questions about the empirical adequacy of game theory.</p> <p>We can here give only a broad overview of an enormous and complicatedliterature. Readers are referred to outstanding surveys in <a href="#Kag95">Kagel and Roth (1995)</a>, <a href="#Cam03">Camerer (2003)</a>, <a href="#Sam05">Samuelson (2005)</a>, and <a href="#Gua05">Guala (2005)</a>. A useful high-level principle for sorting the literature indexes itto the different auxiliary assumptions with which game-theoreticaxioms are applied. It is often said in popular presentations (e.g., <a href="#Orm94">Ormerod 1994</a>) that the experimental data generally refute the hypothesis thatpeople are rational economic agents. Such claims are too imprecise tobe sustainable interpretations of the results. All data are consistentwith the view that people are <em>approximate</em> economic agents, atleast for stretches of time long enough to permit game-theoreticanalysis of particular scenarios, in the minimal sense that theirbehavior can be modeled compatibly with Revealed Preference Theory (see <a href="#Util">Section 2.1</a>). However, RPT makes so little in the way of empirical demands thatthis is not nearly as surprising as many non-economists suppose (<a href="#Ross05a">Ross (2005a)</a>. What is really at issue in many of the debates around the generalinterpretation of experimental evidence is the extent to which peopleare maximizers of expected utility. As we saw in <a href="#Uncer">Section 3</a>, expected utility theory (EUT) is generally applied in tandem withgame theory in order to model situations involving uncertainty —which is to say, most situations of interest in behavioralscience. However, a variety of alternative mathematical accounts ofmaximization lend themselves to Von Neumann-Morgensterncardinalization of utility; and the empirical adequacy of game theorywould be called into question only if we thought that people'sbehavior is not generally describable by means of cardinal VNMufs on asuitably liberal interpretation of these (i.e., as opposed to a narrowinterpretation in which VNM utility is defined strictly in terms ofEUT).</p> <p>What the experimental literature truly appears to show is a world ofbehavior that is very ‘messy’ from the theorist's point ofview. The messiness in question arises from enormous heterogeneity,both among people and among (person, situation) vectors. There is nosingle family of optimization functions such that people act so as tomaximize a member of that family in all circumstances. Faced withwell-learned problems in contexts that are not unduly demanding, orthat are highly institutionally structured people often behave likeexpected utility maximizers. For general reviews of theoretical issuesand evidence, see <a href="#Smi08">Smith (2008)</a>and <a href="#Bin07">Binmore (2007)</a>. For an extended sequence ofexamples of empirical studies, see the so-called ‘continuousdouble auction’ experiments discussed in <a href="#Plott78">Plott and Smith 1978</a> and Smith <a href="#Smi62">1962</a>, <a href="#Smi64">1964</a>, <a href="#Smi65">1965</a>, <a href="#Smi76">1976</a>, <a href="#Smi82">1982</a>. As a result, classical game theory can be used in such domains withhigh reliability to predict behavior and implement public policy, asis demonstrated by the dozens of extremely successful governmentauctions of utilities and other assets designed by game theorists toincrease public revenue (<a href="#Bin02">Binmore and Klemperer 2002</a>).</p> <p>In other contexts, interpreting people's behavior as expected-utilitymaximizing requires undue violence to the principle of parsimony intheory construction. We get better prediction using fewer assumptionsif we suppose that subjects are maximizing according to one of severalalternatives (which will not be described here because they are notdirectly about game theory): a version of prospect theory (<a href="#Kah79">Kahneman and Tversky 1979)</a>, or alpha-nu utility theory (<a href="#Chew79">Chew and MacCrimmon 1979)</a>, or expected utility theory with rank-dependent probabilities (<a href="#Qui82">Quiggin 1982</a>, <a href="#Yaa87">Yaari 1987)</a>. In general, in testing the empirical usefulness (for studying humans)of game theory in conjunction with some theory of the target ofmaximization, it is more often the latter than the former that isadjusted to special cases.</p> <p>A more serious threat to the usefulness of game theory is evidence ofsystematic reversal of preferences, in both humans and otheranimals. This is more serious both because it extends beyond the humancase, and because it challenges Revealed Preference Theory (RPT)rather than just EUT. As explained in <a href="#Util">Section 2.1</a>, RPT, unlike EUT, is among the axiomatic foundations of game theoryinterpreted non-psychologically. (Not all writers agree that apparentpreference reversal phenomena threaten RPT rather than EUT; but seethe discussions in <a href="#Cam95">Camerer (1995)</a>, pp. 660–665, and <a href="#Ross05a">Ross (2005a)</a>, pp. 177–181.) A basis for preference reversals that seems to be common inanimals with brains is <em>hyperbolic discounting of the future</em> (<a href="#Str56">Strotz 1956</a>, <a href="#Ain92">Ainslie 1992</a>). This is the phenomenon whereby agents discount future rewards moresteeply in close temporal distances from the current reference pointthan at more remote temporal distances. This is best understood bycontrast with the idea found in most traditional economic modelsof <em>exponential</em> discounting, in which there is a linearrelationship between the rate of change in the distance to a payoffand the rate at which the value of the payoff from the reference pointdeclines. The figure below shows exponential and hyperbolic curves forthe same interval from a reference point to a future payoff. Thebottom one graphs the hyperbolic function; the bowed shape resultsfrom the change in the rate of discounting.</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure15.jpg" alt="Figure 15" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 15</strong> </blockquote> <p>A result of this is that, as later prospects come closer to the pointof possible consumption, people and other animals will sometimes spendresources undoing the consequences of previous actions that also costthem resources. For example: deciding today whether to mark a pile ofundergraduate essays or watch a baseball game, I procrastinate,despite knowing that by doing so I put out of reach some even more funpossibility that might come up for tomorrow (when there's an equallyattractive ball game on if the better option doesn't arise). So far,this is consistent with rational preference: if the world might endtonight, with a tiny but nonzero probability, then there's some levelof risk aversion at which I'd rather leave the essays unmarked. Thefigure below compares two exponential discount curves, the lower onefor the value of the game I watch before finishing my marking, and thehigher one for the more valuable game I enjoy after completing thejob. Both have higher value from the reference point the closer theyare to it; but the curves do not cross, so my revealed preferences areconsistent over time no matter how impatient I might be.</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure16.jpg" alt="Figure 16" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 16</strong> </blockquote> <p> However, if I bind myself against procrastination by buying a ticketfor tomorrow's game, when in the absence of the awful task I wouldn'thave done so, then I've violated intertemporal preferenceconsistency. More vividly, had I been in a position to choose lastweek whether to procrastinate today, I'd have chosen not to. In thiscase, my discount curve drawn from the reference point of last weekcrosses the curve drawn from the perspective of today, and mypreferences reverse. The figure below shows this situation.</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure17.jpg" alt="Figure 17" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 17</strong> </blockquote> <p>This phenomenon complicates applications of classical game theory tointelligent animals. However, it clearly doesn't vitiate italtogether, since people (and other animals) often <em>don't</em>reverse their preferences. (If this weren't true, the successfulauction models and other s-called ‘mechanism designs’ would bemysterious.) Interestingly, the leading theories that aim to explainwhy hyperbolic discounters often behave in accordance with RPTthemselves appeal to game theoretic principles. <a href="#Ain92">Ainslie (1992</a>, <a href="#Ain01">2001)</a> has produced an account of people as communities of internalbargaining interests, in which subunits based on short-term,medium-term and long-term interests face conflict that they mustresolve because if they don't, and instead generate an internalHobbesian breakdown (<a href="#Mot">Section 1</a>), outside agents who avoid the Hobbesian outcome can ruin themall. The device of the Hobbesian tyrant is unavailable to thebrain. Therefore, its behavior (when system-level insanity is avoided)is a sequence of self-enforcing equilibria of the sort studied bygame-theoretic public choice literature on coalitional bargaining indemocratic legislatures. That is, the internal politics of the brainconsists in ‘logrolling’ (<a href="#Strat97">Stratmann 1997</a>). These internal dynamics are then partly regulated and stabilized bythe wider social games in which coalitions (people as wholes overtemporal subparts of their biographies) are embedded (<a href="#Ross05a">Ross 2005a </a>, pp. 334–353). (For example: social expectations about someone's roleas a salesperson set behavioral equilibrium targets for the logrollingprocesses in their brain.) This potentially adds further relevantelements to the explanation of why and how stable institutions withrelatively transparent rules are key conditions that help people moreclosely resemble straightforward economic agents, such that classicalgame theory finds reliable application to them as entire units.</p> <p>One important note of caution is in order for the reader here. Much ofthe recent behavioral literature takes for granted that temporallyinconsistent discounting is the standard or default case forpeople. However, <a href="#And08">Andersen <em>et al</em> (2008)</a>show empirically that this arises from (i) assuming that groups ofpeople are homogenous with respect to which functional forms bestdescribe their discounting behavior, and (ii) failure to independentlyelicit and control for people's differing levels of risk aversion inestimating their discount functions. In a range of populations thathave been studied with these two considerations in mind, data suggestthat temporally consistent discounting describes substantially higherproportions of choices than does temporally inconsistentchoices. Over-generalization of hyperbolic discounting models shouldthus be avoided. </p> <h3><a name="Neuro">7.2 Neuroeconomics and Game Theory</a></h3> <p>The idea that game theory can find novel application to the internaldynamics of brains, as suggested in the previous section, has beendeveloped from independent motivations by the new research programknown as <em>neuroeconomics</em> (<a href="#Mon02">Montague and Berns 2002</a>, <a href="#Gli03">Glimcher 2003</a>, <a href="#Ross05a">Ross 2005a</a>, pp. 320–334, <a href="#Cam05">Camerer, Loewenstein and Prelec 2005</a>). Thanks to new non-invasive scanning technologies, especiallyfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), it has recently becomepossible to study synaptic activity in working brains while theyrespond to controlled cues. This has allowed direct monitoring accessto the brain's computation of expected values of rewards, which are(naturally) taken to play a crucial role in determiningbehavior. Economic theory is used to frame the derivation of thefunctions maximized by synaptic-level computation of these expectedvalues; hence the name ‘neuroeconomics’.</p> <p>Game theory plays a leading role in neuroeconomics at twolevels. First, game theory has been used to predict the computationsthat individual neurons and groups of neurons serving the rewardsystem must perform. In the best publicized example, <a href="#Gli03">Glimcher (2003)</a> and colleagues have fMRI-scanned monkeys they had trained to playso-called ‘inspection games’ against computers. In aninspection game, one player faces a series of choices either to workfor a reward, in which case he is sure to receive it, or to performanother, easier action (“shirking”), in which case he will receive thereward only if the other player (the “inspector”) is not monitoringhim. Assume that the first player's (the “worker's”) behavior revealsa utility function bounded on each end as follows: he will work onevery occasion if the inspector always monitors and he will shirk onevery occasion if the inspector never monitors. The inspector prefersto obtain the highest possible amount of work for the lowest possiblemonitoring rate. In this game, the only NE for bothplayers are in mixed strategies, since any pattern in one player'sstrategy that can be detected by the other can be exploited. For anygiven pair of specific utility functions for the two players meetingthe constraints described above, any pair of strategies in which, oneach trial, either the worker is indifferent between working andshirking or the inspector is indifferent between monitoring and notmonitoring, is a NE.</p> <p>Applying inspection game analyses to pairs or groups of agentsrequires us to have <em>either</em> independently justified theirutility functions over all variables relevant to their play, in whichcase we can define NE and then test to see whether they successfullymaximize expected utility; <em>or</em> to assume that they maximizeexpected utility, or obey some other rule such as a matching function,and then infer their utility functions from their behavior. Eithersuch procedure can be sensible in different empirical contexts. Butepistemological leverage increases greatly if the utility function ofthe inspector is exogenously determined, as it often is. (Policeimplementing random roadside inspections to catch drunk drivers, forexample, typically have a maximum incidence of drunk driving assignedto them as a target by policy, and an exogenously set budget. Thesedetermine their utility function, given a distribution of preferencesand attitudes to risk among the population of drivers.) In the case ofGlimcher's experiments the inspector is a computer, so its program isunder experimental control and its side of the payoff matrix isknown. Proxies for the subjects' expected utility, in this casesquirts of fruit juice for the monkeys, can be antecedently determinedin parametric test settings. The computer is then programmed with theeconomic model of the monkeys, and can search the data in theirbehavior in game conditions for exploitable patterns, varying itsstrategy accordingly. With these variables fixed,expected-utility-maximizing NE behavior by the monkeys can becalculated and tested by manipulating the computer's utility functionin various runs of the game.</p> <p>Monkey behavior after training tracks NE very robustly (as does thebehavior of people playing similar games for monetary prizes; <a href="#Gli03">Glimcher 2003</a>, pp. 307–308). Working with trained monkeys, Glimcher and colleaguescould then perform the experiments of significance here. Working andshirking behaviors for the monkeys had been associated by theirtraining with staring either to the right or to the left on a visualdisplay. In earlier experiments, <a href="#Pla99">Platt and Glimcher (1999)</a> had established that, in parametric settings, as juice rewards variedfrom one block of trials to another, firing rates of each parietalneuron that controls eye movements could be trained to encode theexpected utility to the monkey of each possible movement relative tothe expected utility of the alternative movement. Thus “movements thatwere worth 0.4 ml of juice were represented twice as strongly [inneural firing probabilities] as movements worth 0.2 ml of juice”(p. 314). Unsurprisingly, when amounts of juice rewarded for eachmovement were varied from one block of trials to another, firing ratesalso varied.</p> <p>Against this background, Glimcher and colleagues could investigate theway in which monkeys' brains implemented the tracking of NE. When themonkeys played the inspection game against the computer, the targetassociated with shirking could be set at the optimal location, giventhe prior training, for a specific neuron under study, while the worktarget would appear at a null location. This permitted Glimcher totest the answer to the following question: did the monkeys maintain NEin the game by keeping the firing rate of the neuron constant whilethe actual and optimal behavior of the monkey as a whole varied? Thedata robustly gave the answer ‘yes’. Glimcher reasonablyinterprets these data as suggesting that neural firing rates, at leastin this cortical region for this task, encode expected utility in bothparametric and nonparametric settings. Here we have an apparentvindication of the empirical applicability of classical game theory ina context independent of institutions or social conventions.</p> <p>Further analysis pushed the hypothesis deeper. The computer playingInspector was presented with the same sequence of outcomes as itsmonkey opponent had received on the previous day's play, and for eachmove was asked to assess the relative expected values of the shirkingand working actions available on the next move. Glimcher reports apositive correlation between small fluctuations around the stable NEfiring rates in the individual neuron and the expected valuesestimated by the computer trying to track the same NE. Glimchercomments on this finding as follows:</p> <blockquote> The neurons seemed to be reflecting, on a play-by-play basis, acomputation close to the one performed by our computer … [A]t a… [relatively] … microscopic scale, we were able to usegame theory to begin to describe the decision-by-decision computationsthat the neurons in area LIP were performing. ( <a href="#Gli03">Glimcher 2003</a>, p. 317) </blockquote> <p>Thus we find game theory reaching beyond its traditional role as atechnology for framing high-level constraints on evolutionary dynamicsor on behavior by well-informed agents operating in institutionalstraightjackets. In Glimcher's hands, it is used to directly modelactivity in a monkey's brain. <a href="#Ross05a">Ross (2005a)</a>argues that groups of neurons thus modeled should not be identifiedwith the sub-personal game-playing units found in Ainslie's theory ofintra-personal bargaining described earlier; that would involve a kindof straightforward reduction that experience in the behavioral andlife science has taught us not to expect. This issue has since arisenin a direct dispute between neuroeconomists over rival interpretationsof fMRI observations of intertemporal choice and discounting(<a href="#McC04">McClure <em>et al</em>.2004)</a>, <a href="#Gli07">Glimcher <em>et al</em>. 2007</a>). Theweight of evidence so far favors the view that if it is sometimesuseful to analyze people's choices as equilibria in games amongstsub-personal agents, the sub-personal agents in question should not beidentified with separate brain areas. The opposite interpretation isunfortunately still most common in less specialized literature. </p> <p>We have now seen the first level at which neuroeconomics applies gametheory. A second level arises thanks to new research methodologydeveloped by Read Montague's team centered at Baylor College ofMedicine. As described earlier in this section, the majority of workin experimental/behavioral economics has involved studying subjectswhile they play games. Initial technical constraints imposed by thefMRI technology prevented analysts from being able to compareinter-personal brain data when subjects are asked to replicate thesegames under neuroimaging. The problem is that the brain doesn'tnecessarily (or even typically) perform the same task using exactlythe same neural resources from one occasion to the next in a singlebrain, let alone from one brain to another. One thus cannot simplyaggregate independent observations under generalizations that linktypes of behavior and their neural signatures. That is, one cannotfirst scan a subject playing one strategic position in a game, thenscan a person in the next strategic position in a repetition of thegame, and so on iteratively, all with a view to assembling a post hocpicture of the brains in interaction. Rather, the interaction itselfmust be directly scanned if one wants an aggregated neural image of agame. However, only one person at a time fits without extremediscomfort into a scanning capsule. Montague and colleagues haveaddressed this problem by developing what they call‘hyperscanning’ software that allows two computers linkedto separate scanners to jointly calibrate the data. Since thecomputers need only be virtually linked, this allows researchers torun experimental games with geographically separated subjects underscanning. Thirty years worth of results in experimental game theorythus stand waiting for re-interpretation under the discipline of apowerful new dimension of empirical measurement. Where formerly wecould only conjecture up to the limits of behavioral discriminationwhich strategies agents implemented under various game conditions, wenow look forward to the prospect of literally watching strategiccomputations as they are carried out.</p> <p>An early instance of this kind of work is <a href="#Kin05">King-Casas <em>et al</em>. (2005)</a>. They took a standard protocol from behavioral game theory, theso-called ‘trust’ game, and implemented it with subjectsunder hyper-scanning. This game involves two players. In its repeatedformat as used in the King-Casas <em>et al</em>. experiment, the firstplayer is designated the ‘investor’ and the second the‘trustee’. The investor begins with $20, of which she cankeep any portion of her choice while investing the remainder with thetrustee. In the trustee's hands the invested amount is tripled by theexperimenter. The trustee may then return as much or as little of thisprofit to the investor as he deems fit. The procedure is run for tenrounds, with players' identities kept anonymous from one another.</p> <p>This game has an infinite number of NE. Previous data from behavioraleconomics are consistent with the claim that the modal NE in humanplay <em>approximates</em> both players using‘Tit-for-tat’ strategies (see <a href="#Repeat">Section 4</a>) modified by occasional defections to probe for information, and somepost-defection cooperation that manifests (limited) toleration of suchprobes. This is a very weak result, since it is compatible with a widerange of hypotheses on exactly which variations of Tit-for-tat areused and sustained, and thus licenses no inferences about potentialdynamics under different learning conditions, institutions, orcross-cultural transfers.</p> <p>When they ran this game under hyperscanning, the King-Casas andMontague group obtained the following results. Neurons in thetrustee's caudate nucleus (generally thought to implement computationsor outputs of midbrain dopaminergic systems) showed strong responsewhen investors benevolently reciprocated trust — that is,responded to defection with increased generosity. As the gameprogressed, these responses shifted from being reactionary to beinganticipatory. Thus reputational profiles as predicted by classicalgame-theoretic models were observed being constructed directly by thebrain. A further aspect of play not predictable by theoreticalmodeling alone, and which purely behavioral observation had not beensufficient to discriminate, is that responses by the caudate neuronsto malevolent reciprocity — reduced generosity in response tocooperation — were significantly smaller in amplitude. This maybe the mechanism by which the brain implements modification ofTit-for-tat so as to prevent occasional defections for informationalprobing from unravelling cooperation permanently. The fact that thesedifferences in response levels can be quantitatively measured suggestthat, once more data from variations (including cross-culturalvariations) on the experiment are in hand, we may come to know indetail which strategies people are disposed use in trust games underdifferent conditions. As noted previously, purely behavioral evidenceunderdetermines this knowledge, merely ruling out strategiesinconsistent with observed equilibria. </p> <p>The advance in understanding promised by this sortof investigation mainly consists not in what it tells us aboutparticular types of games, but rather in comparative inferences itfacilitates about the ways in which contextual framing influencespeople's conjectures about which games they're playing. fMRI probesenable us to quantitatively estimate degrees of strategic<em>surprise</em>. This is a highly portentous new source of leveragefor the empirical application of game theory. Note that reciprocallyinteracting expectations about surprise may themselves be subject tostrategic manipulation, but this is an idea that has barely begun tobe theoretically explored by game theorists (see <a href="#Ross04">Ross and Dumouchel 2004</a>). That we now have the prospect of empirically testing such newtheories, as opposed to just hypothetically modeling them, shouldstimulate their development.</p> <h3><a name="Human">7.3 Game Theoretic Models of Human Nature</a></h3> <p>The developments reviewed in the previous section bring us up to themoving frontier of experimental / behavioral applications of classicalgame theory. We can now return to the branch point left off severalparagraphs back, where this stream of investigation meets that comingfrom evolutionary game theory. There is no serious doubt that, bycomparison to other non-eusocial animals —including our nearestrelatives, chimpanzees and bonobos — humans achieve prodigiousfeats of coordination (see <a href="#Repeat">Section 4</a>) (<a href="#Tom04">Tomasello <em>et al</em>. 2004</a>). A lively controversy, with important philosophical implications andfought on both sides with game-theoretic arguments, currently ragesover the question of whether this capacity can be wholly explained bycultural adaptation, or is better explained by inference to a geneticchange early in the career of <em>H. sapiens</em>.</p> <p> Henrich <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#Hen04">2004</a>, <a href="#Hen05">2005</a>) have run a series of experimental games with populations drawn fromfifteen small-scale human societies in South America, Africa, andAsia, including three groups of foragers, six groups of slash-and-burnhorticulturists, four groups of nomadic herders, and two groups ofsmall-scale agriculturists. The games (Ultimatum, Dictator, PublicGoods) they implemented all place subjects in situations broadlyresembling that of the Trust game discussed in the previoussection. That is, Ultimatum and Public Goods games are scenarios inwhich social welfare can be maximized, and each individual's welfaremaximized (Pareto efficiency achieved) if and only if at least someplayers use strategies that are not sub-game perfect equilibriumstrategies (see <a href="#Subgame">Section 2.6</a>). In Dictator games, a narrowly selfish first mover would capture allavailable profits. Thus in each of the three game types, SPE playerswho cared only about their own monetary welfare would get outcomesthat would involve highly inegalitarian payoffs. In none of thesocieties studied by Henrich <em>et al</em>. (or any other society inwhich games of this sort have been run) are such outcomesobserved. The players whose roles are such that they would take awayall but epsilon of the monetary profits if they and their partnersplayed SPE always offered the partners substantially more thanepsilon, and even then partners sometimes refused such offers at thecost of receiving no money. Furthermore, unlike the traditionalsubjects of experimental economics — university students inindustrialized countries — Henrich <em>et al</em>.'s subjectsdid not even play <em>Nash</em> equilibrium strategies with respect tomonetary payoffs. (That is, strategically advantaged players offeredlarger profit splits to strategically disadvantaged ones than wasnecessary to induce agreement to their offers.) Henrich <em>etal</em>. interpret these results by suggesting that all actual people,unlike ‘rational economic man’, value egalitarian outcomesto some extent. However, their experiments also show that this extentvaries significantly with culture, and is correlated with variationsin two specific cultural variables: typical payoffs to cooperation(the extent to which economic life in the society depends oncooperation with non-immediate kin) and aggregate market integration(a construct built out of independently measured degrees of socialcomplexity, anonymity, privacy, and settlement size). As the values ofthese two variables increase, game behavior shifts (weakly) in thedirection of Nash equilibrium play. Thus the researchers conclude thatpeople are genetically endowed with preferences for egalitarianism,but that the relative weight of these preferences is programmable bysocial learning processes conditioned on local cultural cues.</p> <p>In evaluating Henrich <em>et al</em>.'s interpretation of these data, weshould first note that the axioms defining ‘rational economicman’, which are incorporated into game theory in the waydiscussed in <a href="#Utility">Section 2.1</a>, do not include the property of selfishness. (See <a href="#Ross05a">Ross (2005a)</a> ch. 4; <a href="#Bin05b">Binmore (2005b)</a> and <a href="#Bin09">(2009)</a>; and any economics or game theory text that lets the mathematics dothe talking and doesn't insist on ‘spinning’ it in oneidealogical direction or another.) Orthodox game theory thus does notpredict that people will play SPE or NE strategies derived by treatingmonetary payoffs as equivalent to utility. <a href="#Bin05">Binmore (2005b)</a> is therefore justified in taking Henrich <em>et al</em>. to task overtheir fashionable rhetoric suggesting that their empirical workembarrasses orthodox theory. It does not.</p> <p>This is not to suggest that the anthropological interpretation of theempirical results should be taken as uncontroversial. Binmore (<a href="#Bin94">1994</a>, <a href="#Bin98">1998</a>, <a href="#Bin05a">2005a</a>, <a href="#Bin05b">2005b</a>) has argued for many years, based on a wide range of behavioral data,that when people play games with non-relatives they tend to learn toplay Nash equilibrium with respect to utility functions thatapproximately correspond to income functions. As he points out in <a href="#Bin05b">Binmore (2005b)</a>, Henrich <em>et al</em>.'s data do not test this hypothesis for theirsmall-scale societies, because their subjects were not exposed to thetest games for the (quite long, in the case of the Ultimatum game)learning period that theoretical and computational models suggest arerequired for people to converge on NE. When people play unfamiliargames, they tend to model them by reference to games they are used toin everyday experience. In particular, they tend to play one-shotlaboratory games as though they were familiar <em>repeated</em> games,since one-shot games are rare in normal social life outside of specialinstitutional contexts. Many of the interpretive remarks made byHenrich <em>et al</em>. are consistent with this hypothesis concerningtheir subjects, though they nevertheless explicitly reject the hypothesisitself. What is controversial here — the issues of spin around‘orthodox' theory aside — is less about what theparticular subjects in this experiment were doing than about whattheir behavior should lead us to infer about human evolution.</p> <p><a href="#Gin04">Gintis (2004)</a>, <a href="#Gin09">(2009)</a> arguesthat data of the sort we have been discussing support the followingconjecture about human evolution. Our ancestors were pure maximizersof individual fitness. Somewhere along the evolutionary line theseancestors arrived in circumstances where enough of them maximizedtheir individual fitness by maximizing that of their group(<a href="#Sob98">Sober and Wilson 1998</a>) that a geneticmodification went to fixation in the species: we developed preferencesnot just over our own individual welfare, but over the relativewelfare of all members of our communities, indexed to socialnorms <em>programmable</em> in each individual by culturallearning. Thus the contemporary researcher applying game theory tomodel a social situation is advised to unearth her subjects' utilityfunctions by (i) finding out what community (or communities) they aremembers of, and then (ii) inferring the utility function(s) programmedinto members of that community (communities) by studyingrepresentatives of each relevant community in a range of games andassuming that the outcomes are coordinated equilibria. Since theutility functions are the dependent variables here, the games must beindependently determined. We can typically hold at least the strategicforms of the relevant games fixed, Gintis supposes, by virtue of (a)our confidence that people prefer egalitarian outcomes, all else beingequal, to inegalitarian ones within the culturally evolved‘insider groups’ to which they perceive themselves asbelonging and (b) a requirement that game equilibria are drawn fromstable attractors in plausible evolutionary game-theoretic models ofthe culture's historical dynamics.</p> <p>Requirement (b) as a constraint on game-theoretic modeling of generalhuman strategic dispositions is no longer very controversial —or, at least, is no more controversial than the generic adaptationismin evolutionary anthropology of which it is one expression. However,some commentators are skeptical of Gintis's suggestion that there wasa genetic discontinuity in the evolution of human sociality. (For acognitive-evolutionary anthropology that explicitly denies suchdiscontinuity, see <a href="#Ste03">Sterelny 2003</a>.) Based partly on such skepticism (but more directly on behavioraldata) Binmore (<a href="#Bin05a">2005a</a>, <a href="#Bin05b">2005b</a>) resists modeling people as having built-in preferences foregalitarianism. According to Binmore's (<a href="#Bin94">1994</a>, <a href="#Bin98">1998</a>, <a href="#Bin05a">2005a</a>) model,the basic class of strategic problems facing non-eusocialsocial animals are coordination games. Human communities evolvecultural norms to select equilibria in these games, and many of theseequilibria will be compatible with high levels of apparentlyaltruistic behavior in some (but not all) games. Binmore argues thatpeople adapt their conceptions of fairness to whatever happen to betheir locally prevailing equilibrium selection rules. However, hemaintains that the <em>dynamic</em> development of such norms must becompatible, in the long run, with bargaining equilibria amongself-regarding individuals. Indeed, he argues that as societies evolveinstitutions that encourage what Henrich <em>et al</em>. callaggregate market integration (discussed above), their utilityfunctions and social norms tend to converge on self-regarding economicrationality with respect to welfare. This does not mean that Binmoreis pessimistic about the prospects for egalitarianism: he develops amodel showing that societies of rational bargainers can be pullednaturally along dynamically stable equilibrium paths towards norms ofdistribution corresponding to Rawlsian justice (<a href="#Raw71">Rawls 1971</a>). The principal barriers to such evolution, according to Binmore, areprecisely the kinds of other-regarding preferences that conservativesvalorize as a way of discouraging examination of more egalitarianbargaining equilibria that are within reach along societies'equilibrium paths.</p> <p>Resolution of this debate between Gintis and Binmore fortunately neednot wait upon discoveries about the deep human evolutionary past thatwe may never have. The models make rival empirical predictions of sometestable phenomena. If Gintis is right then there are limits, imposedby the discontinuity in hominid evolution, on the extent to whichpeople can learn to be self-regarding. This is the main significanceof the controversy discussed above over Henrich <em>et al</em>.'sinterpretation of their field data. Binmore's model of socialequilibrium selection also depends, unlike Gintis's, on widespreaddispositions among people to inflict second-order punishment onmembers of society who fail to sanction violators of social norms. <a href="#Gin05">Gintis (2005)</a> shows using a game theory model that this is implausible ifpunishment costs are significant. However, <a href="#Ross05b">Ross (2005b)</a> argues that the widespread assumption in the literature thatpunishment of norm-violation must be costly results from failure toadequately distinguish between models of the original evolution ofsociality, on the one hand, and models of the maintenance anddevelopment of norms and institutions once an initial set of them hasstabilized. Finally, Ross also points out that Binmore's objectivesare as much normative as descriptive: he aims to show egalitarians howto diagnose the errors in conservative rationalisations of the statusquo without calling for revolutions that put equilibrium pathstability (and, therefore, social welfare) at risk. It is a soundprinciple in constructing reform proposals that they should be‘knave-proof’ (as Hume put it), that is, should becompatible with less altruism than <em>might</em> prevail inpeople. Thus, despite the fact that the majority of researchersworking on game-theoretic foundations of social organization presentlyappear to side with Gintis and the other members of the Henrich <em>etal</em>. team, Binmore's alternative model has some strongconsiderations in its favor. Here, then, is another issue along thefrontier of game theory application awaiting resolution in the yearsto come.</p> <p> An enormous range of further applications of both classical andevolutionary game theory have been developed, but we have hopefullynow provided enough to convince the reader of the tremendous, andconstantly expanding, utility of this analytical tool.

(In addition, Binmore offers excursions into a vast rangeof other issues both central and peripheral to both the foundationsand the frontiers of game theory; these books are a tour de force.)And almost everyone will be interested in <a href="#Fra88">Frank (1988)</a> (**), where evolutionary game theory is used to illuminate basicfeatures of human nature and emotion; though readers of this are alsodirected to criticism of Frank's model in <a href="#Ross04">Ross and Dumouchel (2004)</a>.</p> <p>Behavioral and experimental applications of game theory are surveyed in <a href="#Kag95">Kagel and Roth (1995)</a>. <a href="#Cam03">Camerer (2003)</a> (**) is a comprehensive study of this literature (that also brings itup to date), and cannot be missed by anyone interested in theseissues. A shorter survey that emphasizes philosophical andmethodological criticism is <a href="#Sam05">Samuelson (2005)</a>. Philosophical foundations are also carefully examined in <a href="#Gua">Guala (2005)</a>.</p> <p>Two volumes from leading theorists that offer comprehensive views onthe philosophical foundations of game theory were published in2009. These are <a href="#Bin09">Binmore (2009)</a> (**)and <a href="#Gin09">Gintis (2009)</a> (**). Both are indispensible toany new interventions on the subject.</p> <p>A recent volume of interviews with nineteen leading game theorists,eliciting their views on motivations and foundational topics,is <a href="#Hen07">Hendricks and Hansen (2007)</a>.</p> <p>Game-theoretic dynamics of the sub-person receive fascinating, andaccessible, discussion in <a href="#Ain01">Ainslie (2001)</a>. Seminal texts in neuroeconomics, with extensive use of andimplications for behavioral game theory, are <a href="#Mon02">Montague and Berns (2002)</a>, <a href="#Gli03">Glimcher 2003</a> (**), and <a href="#Cam05">Camerer, Loewenstein and Prelec (2005)</a>. <a href="#Ross05a">Ross (2005a)</a> studies the game-theoretic foundations of microeconomics in general,but especially behavioral economics and neuroeconomics, from theperspective of cognitive science.</p> <h3>References</h3> <ul class="hanging"> <li><a name="Ain92">Ainslie, G.

I would also like to thank Sam Lazell for not only catching anasty patch of erroneous analysis in the second version, but going tothe superogatory trouble of actually providing fully correctedreasoning. If there were many such readers, all authors in thisproject would become increasingly collective over time. One of my MBAstudents, Anthony Boting, noticed that my solution to an example Iused in the second version rested on equivocating betweenrelative-frequency and objective-chance interpretations ofprobability. Two readers, Brian Ballsun-Stanton and George Mucalov,spotted this too and were kind enough to write to me about it. Manythanks to them. Joel Guttman pointed out that I'd illustrated a fewprinciples with some historical anecdotes that circulate in the gametheory community, but told them in a way that was too credulous withrespect to their accuracy. Michel Benaim and Mathius Grasselli notedthat I'd identified the wrong Plato text as the source of Socrates'sreflections on soldiers' incentives. Ken Binmore picked up anotherfactual error while the third revision was in preparation, as a resultof which no one else ever saw it. Not so for a mistake found by BobGalesloot that survived in the article all the way into the thirdedition. (That error was corrected in July 2010.)

class="gud_1"> <h1>Avoid High Altitude Sickness</h1> </div> <div class="gud_cont"> <p> As Tibet is a remote area at a high altitude, <strong>altitude sickness (or acute mountain sickness, AMS)</strong>&nbsp;easily occurs.&nbsp;A thorough physical examination is advisable before travelling to Tibet. People with serious heart diseases should not visit Tibet. Those with less serious heart problems need to consult a doctor before starting your trip. People with high or low blood pressure need to consult a doctor before traveling. Try to keep healthy and not to catch a cold before entering Tibet. The first day arriving in Tibet, visitors are advised not to take a bath, smoke and drink alcohol.&nbsp;</p> <p> <strong>Altitude sickness</strong> is considered as the biggest health risk for travelling to Tibet. An altitude over 3,000 meters (9,843 feet) is usually defined as high altitude. Tibet is a land with average elevation above 4,000m. Most part area where people can travel and trek is more than 3,000m, so you need to know how to avoid altitude sickness.</p> <p> <strong>Acute mountain sickness </strong>is common at high altitudes due to the decreasing availability of oxygen. Most people will appear different degrees of symptoms at high elevation, like headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of appetite and disturbed sleep. The occurrence of altitude sickness depends on the altitude. The higher altitude, the serious symptoms appear. If a tourist suffers from altitude sickness, the best remedy is to take him to a lower altitude. It is extremely dangerous to let him traveling to a higher place that may cause more serious symptoms even death within few minutes.</p> <p> Though <strong>altitude sickness </strong>can be very serious, there is only a small part of tourists really suffering from that. Symptoms of altitude sickness include headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of appetite and disturbed sleep. Most people will experience one or more altitude sickness symptoms upon their arrival in Tibet. And they can soon acclimatize on the first one or two days in Lhasa. The symptoms will usually gradually decrease or disappeared.</p> <p> Here are some good methods to help you <strong>avoid altitude sickness </strong>in Tibet.</p> <p> 1. Before visiting Tibet, get healthy as possible, both physically and psychologically. Visitors having heart disease, high blood pressure or other organ problems or anemia should consult their doctor before making the decision to visit Tibet.</p> <p> 2. If you go to Tibet for trekking, please make physical exercise plan one month before you fly to the high altitude, swimming, long distance walking, tennis or something.</p> <p> 3. Please take care of yourself and avoid catching cold before you go to Tibet, you will easily suffer from altitude sickness under weak physical condition.</p> <p> 4. Please do not drink any alcohol on the first two days you are in Tibet. You need to bring enough water or drinks and fruits, snacks with high caloric content, like chocolate.</p> <p> 5. It is better not to take shower at the first two days you are in Lhasa, because you are facing the danger of catching a cold.</p> <p> 6. Don’t be so exciting upon your arrival in Tibet, and do not run, jump or do some taxing job at the first two days. Being peaceful and having a good rest are important.</p> <p> 7. Once you have the symptoms of altitude sickness, please report to your tour guide immediately, and don’t go higher with symptoms of altitude sickness.</p> <p> 8. Medication and oxygen also help to prevent altitude sickness. Mild altitude sickness symptoms can be treated with proper medication. If medication and oxygen do not relieve the symptoms, go to hospital or evacuate immediately to a safe altitude!</p> <p> 9. Oxygen can help you relieve the symptoms of altitude sickness, but please do not use it often in Lhasa while your symptoms of altitude sickness are not serious. Most of our clients has more than 4 days itinerary covering<a href="http://tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-guide/namtso-lake.html"> Namtso</a>(4800m), <a href="http://tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-guide/everest-base-camp.html">Everest Base Camp</a>(5200m) etc, the oxygen treatment does not work at a higher altitude if they take too much at a lower altitude.</p> <p> If you feel chilly or feel very uncomfortable, you need to tell your guide about this. You guide could send you to the best hospital available in the area.</p> <p> Except altitude sickness, there are another health risks in Tibet. Insects might be one of them, particularly in the wild. Protect yourself from insect bites by using insect repellant or spray. Some tourists may be confronted with life-threatening allergic reactions after being bit by insects. In this case, go back to a city nearby to visit a doctor as soon as possible. Do not eat food bought from the street venders. Otherwise, gastrointestinal disorders might visit you and spoil your trip.</p> <p> If you want to enjoy a trek in Tibet, especially a long trek, it is necessary to work toward excercising a few times a week for about 30 minutes each time. Walking, running, cycling and Hillwalking with a pack weighing 5-10 Kilos or10-20 pounds are good preparation for trekking. Swimming is also a fun and excellent form of training because it does not put stress upon your joints. In order to arrive for your expedition in top shape, please take plenty of rest and do not over-do it. Adequate rest and a well balanced diet are essential to avoid injury and illness before trekking.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> More tips:<br /> 1. Drink plenty of water while traveling in Tibet. Eat light, high-carbohydrate meals for more energy and avoid alcohol so as to decrease the risk of dehydration.<br /> 2. Sunscreen, sunglasses, lip creams are recommended to protect your eyes and skin because the solar radiation strikes the earth with unusual intensity due to the high altitude and the thin atmosphere in Tibet.<br /> 3. In addition to the normal medications for traveling it is advisable to bring high altitude medication. Seek suggestions from your doctor.<br /> 4. Tell your guide quickly if you don't feel well and follow the guide's advice.</p> </div> <div class="gud_sug" style="height:225px"> <div class="gud_sug_1"> Know more about Tibet Travel Advice </div> <div class="gud_sug_2" style="height:205px"> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-advice/faqs-on-kathmandu-to-lhasa.html" title="FAQs on How to travel from Kathmandu to Lhasa">FAQs on How to travel from Kathmandu to Lhasa</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-advice/all-trains-to-tibet.html" title="How to get to Tibet by train, All Trains to Tibet">How to get to Tibet by train, All Trains to Tibet</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-advice/best-way-to-tibet.html" title="What is the best way to get to Tibet">What is the best way to get to Tibet</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-advice/trekking-advice.html" title="Advice For Trekking in Tibet,advice on tibet trek">Advice For Trekking in Tibet,advice on tibet trek</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-advice/what-to-eat-in-tibet.html" title="What and Where to Eat and Drink in Tibet">What and Where to Eat and Drink in Tibet</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-advice/travel-in-tibet.html" title="How to travel in Tibet">How to travel in Tibet</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-advice/Tibet_Winter_Mountaineering_Tips_702.html" title="Tibet Winter Mountaineering Tips">Tibet Winter Mountaineering Tips</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-advice/must-visit-cities.html" title="The fantastic destinations in Tibet you shouldn't miss in your Tibet trip">The fantastic destinations in Tibet you shouldn't miss in your Tibet trip</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-advice/tibet-travel-faq.html" title="FAQs of travelling to Tibet for foreigners">FAQs of travelling to Tibet for foreigners</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-advice/tibet-entry-permit-for-free.html" title="Tibet Entry Permit For Free">Tibet Entry Permit For Free</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-advice/how-to-prevent-altitude-sickness.html" title="How to Avoid Altitude Sickness, Advice from Doctor">How to Avoid Altitude Sickness, Advice from Doctor</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-advice/trip-to-everest-base-camp.html" title="Plan a Mt Everest Base Camp Tour in Tibet,Must-see information before you go">Plan a Mt Everest Base Camp Tour in Tibet,Must-see information before you go</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-advice/everest-base-camp-tour-accommodation.html" title="Hotels along the way from Lhasa to Everest Base Camp">Hotels along the way from Lhasa to Everest Base Camp</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-advice/kora.html" title="What is Kora in Tibet">What is Kora in Tibet</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-advice/vegetarian.html" title="Tibet Travel Tips for vegetarian tourists to Tibet">Tibet Travel Tips for vegetarian tourists to Tibet</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-advice/drinking-water.html" title="Is drinking water safe in Tibet?">Is drinking water safe in Tibet?</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-advice/accommodation-in-tibet.html" title="How is the accommodation in Tibet?

But as anybody who has spent time around houseplants knows, there's often a huge learning curve between keeping a plant alive and getting it to flower. So in some ways, this list of the best flowering houseplants represents a master class in green-thumbery.</p> <p>But don't despair. The plants on this list are usually already flowering by the time they're offered for sale, and in some cases, they aren't really meant to be flowered by home gardeners. This is especially true of the holiday plants (I'm thinking about you, poinsettias). Other plants on this list are easier to flower at home, and once you get the basics, you can expect regular blooms.</p> <h3>Top Twelve Flowering Houseplants</h3> <a href="http://houseplants.about.com/od/foliageplants/p/AfricanViolets.htm"><b>African Violets</b></a> <p>African violets have a passionate following, and it's no wonder why. These plants are compact and free flowering with a wide variety of flower forms and colors. With careful watering, high humidity and bright, but not direct, light, it is possible to coax forth several blooms every year. Some master growers can keep their African violets in bloom nearly all year round.</p> <a href="http://houseplants.about.com/od/foliageplants/a/Poinsettias.htm"><b>Poinsettias</b></a> <p>Poinsettias are the single most popular houseplant in the world, which is even more incredible considering that virtually all of these plants are purchased around Christmas time. In recent years, growers have introduced new poinsettia varieties, in pink and white and variegated colors, but the standard red poinsettia is still the king of Christmas plants. The actual flowers on these plants are insignificant—it's the big red bracts surrounding the flowers that we like so much. Beware, though: only a truly dedicated grower can bring a standard poinsettia back into bloom the next year.</p> <a href="http://houseplants.about.com/od/growingorchidsinside/a/Orchidshouse.htm"><b>Orchids</b></a> <p>Orchids are the largest group of plants in the world, with some 30,000 known species and tens of thousands more hybrids. In her book <i>The Orchid Thief</i>, author Susan Orlean described an orchid show and the dazzling variety of flowers in all colors and shapes. Some are breathtaking, some are strange, and some border on downright ugly. Home growers tend to concentrate on about five popular species, and despite their reputation for difficulty, any careful grower should be able to bring their orchids back into bloom.</p> <a href="http://houseplants.about.com/od/foliageplants/p/PeaceLily.htm"><b>Peace Lilies (<i>Spathiphyllum</i>)</b></a> <p>Peace lilies are often found in upscale home designs, their folded white flowers nodding peacefully over glossy leaves. These tropical plants prefer filtered light, warmth and humidity, and under the right conditions, flowers will appear in the late summer and last for weeks.</p> <b>Begonia</b> <p>Flowering begonias are usually thought of as outdoor plants, but they also possess all the characteristics of a great indoor plant. They are tough, undemanding and free flowering. A simple pot of begonias can be planted for next to nothing and will yield a nice season of color. Better yet, there are untold varieties of begonia, including the trailing or bushy varieties, and all manner of foliage begonias. Somewhere in this vast pool of plants is one that will grow in your particular conditions.</p> <a href="http://houseplants.about.com/od/bromeliads/a/Bromeliads.htm"><b>Bromeliads</b></a> <p>Sometimes called urn plants, most bromeliads grow in rosettes of strappy leaves that form a central water-collecting cup. Their flowers arise from the center of this cup in tall, colorful spikes of bracts. They can be difficult to bring into bloom, but fortunately, new bromeliad flowers often last for weeks or months and they have beautiful foliage.</p> <a href="http://houseplants.about.com/od/succulentsandcacti/a/CactiBasics.htm"><b>Desert Cacti</b></a> <p>If you've ever seen a desert in full bloom, then you already know that desert cacti feature some of the most beautiful flowers in the world. There are many varieties of cacti available, and about half of them can be bloomed in the average home. Give your cactus lots of sunlight, hold off on the water, and wait for spring or summer.</p> <a href="http://houseplants.about.com/od/succulentsandcacti/p/Kalanchoe.htm"><b>Kalanchoe</b></a> <p>These unassuming plants made the list for a simple reason: they are easy to grow and almost as easy to bloom with clusters of small, upright flowers. The most popular variety, K. blossfeldiana, is a dependable bloomer in the spring, provided it's given bright light and adequate water. Kalanchoes are succulents, so the basic rules for growing succulents will work well for them also.</p> <a href="http://houseplants.about.com/od/foliageplants/p/Amaryllis.htm"><b>Amaryllis (<i>Hippeastrum hybrida</i>)</b></a> <p>The amaryllis is one of the most magnificent of all bulbs. Technically a Hippeastrum hybrida, the amaryllis bears large, deeply colored flowers on tall stalks. They are sold as potted flowering plants or naked bulbs, and they are available in red, salmon, pink, orange and multicolored. They typically flower from late December until early summer, depending on when the bulb is planted. At the end of its growth cycle, bulbs can be removed from the soil and stored in a cool, dry place for at least six weeks, then replanted and brought to bloom again.</p> <a href="http://houseplants.about.com/od/succulentsandcacti/a/CactiBasics.htm"><b>Christmas Cactus</b></a> <p>Christmas cactus are technically subtropical forest cacti. They have beautiful, drooping red or pink flowers on unique, paddle-like foliage. They are usually bought in bloom already, but it is possible to bring a Christmas cactus back to bloom.</p> <a href="http://houseplants.about.com/od/foliageplants/p/Hibiscus.htm"><b>Hibiscus</b></a> <p>The hibiscus is one of the most enduring symbols of the tropics. These flower are available in single and double forms, and in a dizzying array of colors. Some of the newer hybrids feature multicolored flowers as large as a salad plate. The hibiscus is not a plant for beginners, either to keep alive or bloom. They insist on warmth, lots of light, humidity, and they are prone to several varieties of bugs. But for those who have the gumption to make it happen, a flowering hibiscus is one of the most remarkable sights in any temperate home.</p> <a href="http://houseplants.about.com/od/foliageplants/p/Anthurium.htm"><b>Anthurium</b></a> <p>The genus anthurium boasts some of the most striking plants in the world, but the only one you're likely to find in an average gardening center is the A. scherzerianum. These plants have distinctive red flower structures that feature a heart-shaped red spathe from which emerges a white or yellow flower spike. Anthuriums are true jungle plants, which makes them a challenge to grow and bloom in ordinary conditions. They thrive on humidity, heat, ample water, bright light and rich soil. Most anthuriums are bought in bloom, and it takes a skillful hand to bring one back into flower.</p> <!--/gc--> </div> <div id="coda"> <div id="resources"> <div class="lkbx"> <h5>Suggested

While some men think that a tie is simply a tie, others know that there are varied ways to knot a tie to produce different looks, depending on the occasion as well as the shirt worn. Many men rely on one or two basic styles. If you're particularly interested in fashion, knowing the difference between tie styles is important.</p> <h2>The Windsor Knot</h2> <p>The Windsor knot is distinguishable from the half-Windsor in size. The half-Windsor is not actually half the size of a Windsor knot, but it is smaller. The Windsor works best with wide spread collar shirts. Its look is traditional and produces a wide triangular knot at the neck. While there exists some debate on where this tie shape got its name (whether it was after the Duke of Windsor or his grandfather, Edward VII), it's generally believed that it derived from the way the Duke of Windsor preferred his ties to be worn. Instead of the classic four-in-hand knot, which is narrower in shape, Edward VIII preferred a larger knot. As a result, he requested that his ties be made in a thicker material to produce this more substantial shape. The Windsor knot is typically worn on more <a href="/Black_Tie_Attire" title="Black Tie Attire">formal</a> occasions.</p> <script type="text/javascript">var google_ad_channel='2462822152';var google_ad_client='pub-3619764495662405';var google_ad_output='js';var google_ad_type='text';var google_image_size='468x60';var google_max_num_ads='3';</script> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script> <h2>Instructions on How to Tie a Windsor Knot</h2> <p>If you're ready to try your hand at a new tie style, follow these instructions to produce a Windsor knot worthy of admiration:</p> <ol> <li>Drape your tie around your neck, with the wide end on your right. The narrow end, on your left, should be much shorter than the wide end.</li> <li>Bring the wide end of your tie over the narrow end, close to your neck.</li> <li>Carry the wide end up through the formed loop and bring it to your left.</li> <li>Now bring the wide end behind the narrow end toward your right.</li> <li>Bring the wide end through the middle of the formed loop, carrying it from the right side to the left.</li> <li>Now bring the wide end around the front of your tie, from the left to the right side.</li> <li>Bring the wide end through the back of your loop, from the right to the center.</li> <li>Use your finger to hold the front of the knot loose; bring the wide end down through the loop in the front.</li> <li>Take your finger out and tighten the knot.</li> <li>Hold onto the narrow end and pull the knot firmly up to your collar.</li> </ol> <p>If you've never tied a Windsor knot before, following these instructions will probably take quite a bit of practice before you master the perfect knot. Look in a mirror and take your time with each step. The wrong time to practice is five minutes before leaving for your formal function when you've never attempted it before! With practice, you'll soon have the knack for tying a Windsor knot that a Duke would admire.</p> <p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9T6xBfq77hg&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9T6xBfq77hg&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344" /></object></p> <h2>Following Fashions</h2> <p>If you follow men's fashion trends, you'll notice that tie styles come in and out of vogue, just as with various women's fashions. Sometimes, skinny ties are in; at other times, men are advised to avoid them like the plague. A great deal of <a href="/How_to_Put_on_a_Tie" title="How to Put on a Tie">how you wear your ties</a> depends on how much you follow trends.</p> <p>Many men wear one basic tie style their entire lives, either because they prefer it or because they're not interested in learning how to tie other knots. They have no use for learning <a href="/How_to_Tie_a_Necktie" title="How to Tie a Necktie">how to tie a Windsor knot</a> and that suits them just fine. The Windsor sometimes appears too fussy and contrived to certain men, and so they avoid it.</p> <p>For other men, who often have formal events to attend, or who simply like appearing well dressed for every occasion, being knowledgeable about different knot styles is important. They'll know that longer ties are best for achieving enviable Windsor knots. They'll also know that their knots should be symmetrical and that Windsor knots are made to call attention to themselves, as well as to the man stylish enough to wear them. .</p> <div id="more"> <h2>Related Topics</h2> <div id="slideshow"> <div class="image feature"> <a title="" rel="slideshow" href="/Slideshow:Colonial_Fashion"><img src="http://cf.ltkcdn.net/mens-fashion/images/feat-lg/48998-280x190r1-Colonials-with-oxen.jpg" alt="" /> <div class="overlay"></div></a> <div class="caption"> <a rel="slideshow" href="/Slideshow:Colonial_Fashion">Colonial Fashion</a> </div> </div> </div> <ul id="related"> <li><a href="/Double_Windsor_Tie_Knot">Double Windsor Tie Knot</a></li> <li><a title="a yellow necktie with a perfect knot" href="/How_to_Tie_a_Necktie">How to Tie a Necktie</a></li> <li><a title="tying a tie" href="/Necktie_Knots">Necktie Knots</a></li> <li><a title="tying a tie" href="/Instructions_on_How_to_Tie_a_Tie">Instructions on How to Tie a Tie</a></li> <li><a href="/How_to_Tie_a_Silk_Tie">How to Tie a Silk Tie</a></li> <li><a title="makeatie" href="/How_to_Make_a_Tie">How to Make a Tie</a></li> <li><a href="/How_to_Put_on_a_Tie">How to Put on a Tie</a></li> <li><a title="Adjusting Necktie" href="/Necktie_Instructions">Necktie Instructions</a></li> <li><a href="/How_to_Tie_a_Tie">How to Tie a Tie</a></li> <li><a title="shopping" href="/Category:Mens_Fashion_Tips">Men's Fashion Tips</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.lovetoknow.com/style.html">Beauty &amp;

The era was one of prudish Victorians. It was also the age of the continued Enlightenment. The New Formula of science, along with the legacy of Comte�s Positivism, had a firm hold on the burgeoning discipline of psychology. Freud was groomed as both scientist and Romantic, but his life�s work reflected conflict of the two backgrounds and a reaction against each one. It is my opinion that The Interpretation of Dreams was not simply written as a methodology of deconstructing dreams and assigning them meaning, but its latent content (as it were) was a critique of science�s New Formula, and was designed to question, and even undermine, the possibility of objective methodology in psychology, and indeed in the sciences as a whole.The importance of his innovations were wholly unappreciated; Freud was an anomaly. Many of his contemporaries rejected his work on the grounds of invalid methodology and inconsistency. Neurologists and psychiatrists today still continue to discount his theories. The point of Freud�s subversion of contemporary mental science, was, however, quite missed, and many critics and reviewers continue to systemically assail his work, utterly oblivious to the inclusive meaning of his theories, rather than the meanings of his words themselves.Clinical studies convinced Freud that hysterical symptoms could be analyzed and deconstructed to understandable statements expressive of some underlying and utterly logical thought. From this interest, Freud embarked on a comprehensive study of dreams, and in the process, created a theory that drew meaningful attention to the unconscious, a previously unaddressed part of the human psyche.Freud�s dreambook presented a new psychology for the times, as well as a new understanding of dreams. The implications of this novel understanding spilled over into the budding field of humanistic psychology, as well as into many new theoretical writings spanning areas from social sciences to fine arts.Freud�s work made interesting contributions to general psychology because, in offering the idea that dreams have meaning that could be comprehended and interpreted, he was taking the side of the ignorant and the superstitious against the positivist philosophy of early science psychology. Thus, the text can be read not only in the context of social and intellectual traditions impinging on fin-de-siecle culture, but more generally in relation to a broader framework of changing western conceptions of the nature and importance of dreams. Freud�s writings on dreams provide an ideal psychology of modern life, and this is especially clear if his work is viewed in the context of the major transformations in the understanding of dreams that have characterized different periods of development within psychology.For Freud, the possibility of dream interpretation is contingent on the premise that their puzzling and seemingly nonsensical elements actually contain a series of clues from which their originating ideas can be deduced. Dreams are, in some sense, designated to conceal events/emotions that would be too painful for a person to recall, but nonetheless do so in such a way as to still communicate those very events or emotions in a disguised and indirect form. Freud distinguishes between latent (hidden) and manifest (surface) contents of dreams. There is a complex process of partial concealment, both the function and method of which require elaboration.Freud began to analyze his own dreams, and was quite excited by the analytic insight which he believed his first dream interpretation produced. This dream specifically became known as the dream of Irma�s Injection, and serves as the �specimen dream� that Freud uses for the starting point of The Interpretation of Dreams. The interpretation of this dream, as of any other, depends on the spontaneous association of the dreamer to each of its elements. It is the dreamer, and not the analyst, who provides the interpretation. Therefore, in this case, Freud begins the analysis with his own immediate reactions to the dream. It comes to light that dreams are organized in terms of relationships between events and emotions concerning these events. The dream also clearly makes sense in the context of the dreamer�s current waking preoccupations and activities. The dream-thoughts appear absorbed in characteristically mundane themes, yet, considering what initially appears to be incidental elements in this dream, Freud is compelled to recall events from a more remote past. Thus, distant events are connected with incidents from the previous day through an unpredictable series of links. The dream-thoughts are consistent and logical, it is only the complexity of the allusions through which they are expressed that give rise to the appearance of over-complication and arbitrariness. So-called �indifferent material� in the dream can serve as a useful bridge between two sets of events on the day previous to a dream. It is also characteristic, Freud claims, for each element of the dream�s content to be �overdetermined�, i.e., to be over-represented in the dream-thoughts. Though Freud occasionally refers to the �ultimate meaning� of a dream, the meaning of a dream consists simply in the dreamer�s articulation of associations to its images. A problem here is that this process of anatomizing and connecting the elements of the dream with memories of both significant and indifferent events might be continued indefinitely, with no certainty of reaching a definite interpretation.What can be difficult for the reader to understand, is the manner of representation that characterizes the process of dreaming. Freud uses an example of a botanical monograph dream to explicate a few general features of dreams, through which dream-content is related to underlying dream-thoughts. He discusses the problem of connecting the two in terms of a translation:The dream thought and the dream-content are presentedto us like two versions of the same subject matter in twodifferent languages. Or, more properly, the dream-content seems like a transcript of the dream thoughts inanother mode of expression, whose characters andsyntactic laws it is our business to discover by comparingthe original and the translation. The dream-thoughts areimmediately comprehensible, as soon as we have learnt them. The dream content, on the other hand, is expressedas it were a pictographic script, the characters of whichhave to be transposed individually into the language of the dream-thoughts. If we attempted to read thesecharacters according to their pictorial value instead ofaccording to their symbolic relation, we should clearly be led into error (S. Freud, 1971, Vol. 4, p.277).There is a diversity and richness to the meaningful associations that emerge from what is dreamt as a simple image. Processes of condensation and displacement of meaning are key elements to the understanding these associations.The most significant relations of associations to emerge in dreams, however, are expressed through variations in sensory intensities among different dream-images, or even entire dreams. While Freud admits that physiological or waking concerns can penetrate the dream state on occasion (such as dreaming of drinking a cool glass of water when you go to bed thirsty), he denies any special prominence to these causes. Nor is the vividness or clarity of dream-images indicative of psychical value between the dream-images and their meanings. All dreams serve the purpose of fulfilling a wish. Often (but not always) these dreams can trace back to sexual or aggressive motives. For example, the specimen dream of Irma�s Injection is not only interpreted in terms of its associations to which it gives rise, but is analyzed as a wish fulfilment; the dream satisfies a desire on the part of Freud�s to be highly regarded by his colleagues, as well as one to absolve himself of responsibility of misdiagnosis while assigning blame on his physician-friend. Throughout the course of the text, the idea of wishing becomes gradually transformed; it is not simply that more �dangerous� wishes come to emerge in the interpreted meaning, but that these wishes, with respect to their associations, refer to events (again, often sexual or aggressive) of earlier, especially childhood, events in the life of the dreamer. Events that are normally forgotten and inaccessible to the waking mind.Freud�s method of interpretation through spontaneous association, and analysis of the mechanism of content representation through a desire for wish fulfilment, is formulated in distinction to what he took to be the commonly-held historical tradition of symbolic understanding. Freud rejects a universal key for symbols in dream interpretation. His own method of interpretation, founded on contextualization of each dream element, cannot support an array of fixed symbolic meanings. However, by the end of the text, Freud finds symbolism to be important because it permits him to translate psychoanalysis into a general cultural science, a manoeuvre he requires in order to have his �new science of the mind� accepted on a broad level. He maintains that symbols are subject to elements peculiar to the dreamer. �They [dream symbols] frequently have more than one or even several meanings, and, as with Chinese script, the correct interpretation can only be arrived at one each occasion from the context� (S. Freud, 1968, Vol.5, p.353). Nevertheless, he ultimately creates a variety of common examples of fixed symbolic meaning in dreams, usually sexual in nature. This type of universal symbolism is what has become popularly called the typical �Freudian� method of dream interpretation.A difficulty with the dream theory is that the dreamer must remember the dream in full detail. And since dreams occur in the unconscious, it is likely that at least some aspects of a dream will be either forgotten, erroneous, or both. Freud also notes that the dreamer may unconsciously invent aspects of missing portions of a dream. Addressing these problems, Freud states that the dream must be acceptable as total fact if it is to be interpreted; this seems contrary to his usual tendency to continuously question the validity of patients� statements.Another difficulty with the theory, more with respect to its reliability, is that there is no standardized diagnoses available for dream analysis. That is, universal key symbols are mentioned, but it is also stated that what an object symbolizes varies for each individual. Also, the analyst must be in possession of significant background information on the dreamer in order to make a genuine and accurate interpretation with respect to symbols. Inaccuracies can again occur because the dreamer is repressing certain events/emotions, rendering them totally inaccessible as the root meanings of certain symbols.The point I am trying to make is that no dream is utterly, truly, objectively, and replicably interpretable. Freud himself admits that many obstacles stand in the way of a correct interpretation, though he still proceeds as though his interpretations are true, objective, and replicable. He cites case after case of �successful� dream interpretation. In many of these examples, his attempt to shock and dismay his readers, and the medical community alike, is patent in his use of symbolic sexual imagery within the dreams he discusses. This desire to shock, was also part of Freud�s subversion of psychology; he sought to shock his readers with blatant sexual references because he wanted an emotional reaction from them, not simply a passive assimilation of his theory. By doing this, he hoped to change the way people thought, causing them to use their emotions, their passions, and not simply their analytic minds. Thus, I propose that the hidden meaning of Freud�s theory itself is likely a critique of the scientific method, a negative view of Positivism, if you will. He offers a methodology, states that it may not be objective, based on certain faulty criteria, then concludes with a valid outcome that is proclaimed scientific and successful. Freud is both appeasing and satirizing his predecessors from the scientific community while remaining loyal to his ideals of romanticism.Freud�s theory of dream interpretation is both simple and comprehensive. His typical method of interpretation is one in which the motive and dream are introduced, and their contents assigned, by previously accepted criteria. The wish, in contrast, is introduced by hypothesis, or inference to the best explanation. There are several reasons why dream analysis cannot constitute a natural science. Freud himself was well aware of these barriers, yet he nevertheless proceeded with his theory in spite of his acknowledgement of its flaws. Therefore, on a greater level, we the readers are left to interpret this as Freud�s parody of natural science itself, of an inability to obtain truly objective, utter replicable result, under any condition. Freud sets out to show us that if a painstakingly laid out scientific method, such as his for dream interpretation, can contain contradictions with respect to reliability and objectivity, so can any scientific method concerning any type of material. The biggest implication for Positivism then is one of doubt, because once doubt sets in, confidence is lost. Nevertheless, The Interpretation of Dreams has made a major contribution to psychology by its introduction of certain concepts, such as depth of mind, latent meanings, wish-fulfilments, etc.,--all of which remain valuable in themselves, in spite of Freud�s parallel objective of crushing positivistic natural science. Freud�s work has provided a paradigm through historical findings and future investigations, leaving him as pioneer of the unconscious through his unmasking of dreams. And lastly, in spite of science and philosophy�s tendencies to exploit the theory�s weaknesses instead of strengths, the deeper aim of the text, as unmasker of Positivism�s weaknesses, can no longer be ignored in its hermeneutic exploration.<br /><br /><b>Bibliography</b><br /><br />Reference ListFreud, Sigmund.

habit of tunneling into decks, porches, and other wood structures. Males behave aggressively during their spring mating season, which can be a bit unsettling if you're trying to relax on your deck. Your first impulse might be to grab a can of bug spray to battle these large bees, but please don't. Learn when control measures are needed and when they aren't, and how to control carpenter bees effectively.</p> <h3>What Are Carpenter Bees?</h3> <p>People often mistake carpenter bees for bumblebees, which look quite similar. Bumblebees (<a href="http://insects.about.com/od/antsbeeswasps/p/genusbombus.htm">genus Bombus</a>) nest in the ground, usually in abandoned rodent nests, and live in social communities. Carpenter bees (<a href="http://insects.about.com/od/antsbeeswasps/p/carpenter-bees.htm">genus Xylocopa</a>) are solitary bees that burrow into wood. If you see a bee that looks like a bumblebee emerging from a hole in your porch, it's a carpenter bee, not a bumblebee. You can differentiate the two by examining the dorsal (upper) side of the abdomen. If it's shiny and hairless, it's a carpenter bee. A bumblebee, by contrast, has a hairy abdomen.</p> <p>Carpenter bees usually spend the cold months tucked inside their empty nest tunnels, protected from freezing temperatures and winter weather. In spring, they emerge ready to mate. The female carpenter bee excavates a tunnel for her offspring. In each brood chamber, she stores food and lays an egg. By late summer, her young emerge as adults. The new generation of carpenter bees will visit flowers briefly in August and September, before settling in for the winter.</p> <p>Carpenter bees are <a href="http://insects.about.com/od/antsbeeswasps/tp/10-native-pollen-bees.htm">excellent pollinators</a>. When a carpenter bee lands on a flower, she vibrates her thoracic muscles to shake the pollen loose. Because carpenter bees are beneficial insects, you should only eliminate them when necessary. </p> <h3>Do Carpenter Bees Sting?</h3> <p>Most people encounter carpenter bees during April and May, when they've just emerged to mate. During this time, male carpenter bees tend to hover around nest openings, looking for receptive females. It can be rather unnerving being around them, as the males will also hover aggressively around people who approach the nests. They may even fly right into you. Despite this tough act, <b>male carpenter bees cannot sting</b>. They are completely harmless. Female carpenter bees can sting, but almost never do. You would have to provoke a female, perhaps by trying to cup her in your hands, to get her to sting you in self-defense. So <b>carpenter bees pose almost no threat to people at all.</b> </p> <h3>How to Identify Carpenter Bee Nests</h3> <p>Obviously, if you observe carpenter bees coming and going from holes in your fascia board, deck posts, or other wood structures, that's a sure sign that those holes are carpenter bee nests.</p> <p>If you haven't seen bees, but suspect they may be burrowing in a fence or other structure, look at the entrance holes. A carpenter bee makes an entrance hole slightly bigger than her body, or just about &frac12; inch in diameter. The first inch or two of the tunnel is usually made against the wood grain. The bee will then make a right turn and extend the tunnel another 4-6 inches in the direction of the wood grain. Carpenter bees will often eliminate their waste before entering their nest, so you might see yellow stains on the surface of the wood, just below the entrance hole. </p> <p>Though they burrow into wood, carpenter bees don't eat wood like <a href="http://insects.about.com/od/termites/p/char_isoptera.htm">termites</a> do. Since their nest tunnels are limited in size, they rarely do serious structural damage. However, because such excavation requires a lot of energy on her part, a female carpenter bee will often prefer to refurbish an old tunnel to digging a new one. If carpenter bees are allowed to tunnel in the same structure year after year, the cumulative damage could be significant.</p> <h3>How to Control Carpenter Bees</h3> <p>When it comes to carpenter bees, your best defense is a good offense. Carpenter bees prefer to excavate untreated, unfinished wood. You can discourage, if not prevent, carpenter bees from nesting in a wood structure by painting or varnishing the lumber.</p> <p>If carpenter bees are already a problem, you will need to use an insecticidal dust to treat the nests. Insecticidal dusts are usually applied with a puffer that allows you to coat the interior surface of the entrance holes with the insecticide using a gentle burst of air. Contact <a href="http://www.csrees.usda.gov/Extension/" zt="-o1/XJ" target="_blank">your local extension office</a> to find out which insecticides are effective and legal for use on carpenter bees in your area.</p> <p> For the insecticide to work, the bees much come in contact with it as they crawl through the entrance hole of the nest. Apply the appropriate insecticidal dust in the spring, just before adults emerge to mate. Once you see the bees emerge, wait a few days before filling in the nest holes with wood putty or filler.</p> <p>If you didn't apply the insecticide before the spring adults emerged, you will need to treat the nests twice – once in the spring, and again in late summer, when the next generation of adults is foraging. Because bees will be active during the day, it's preferable to apply the pesticide at night. This will reduce your chances of being stung by females trying to defend their nests. In the fall, seal the nest holes with putty or filler.</p> <sub><p>Sources:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/ent/notes/Urban/carpenterbees.htm" zt="-o1/XJ" target="_blank">NCSU
