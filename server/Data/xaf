Sudden death is more common in women partially because women do not always recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. Symptoms for women can be slightly different than those for men. As reported in the New England Journal of <a href="http://www.womensheart.org/content/heartattack/heart_attack_facts.aspcts">Medicine</a>, the grim reality of women under the age of 40 who have heart attacks are twice as likely to die than men. In the U. S. a heart attack occurs in someone every 20 seconds.</p> <p>Most of the deaths occur outside of a hospital setting within the first hour, which is why it is so important to call 911 if you have any symptoms. Certainly erring on the side of protecting yourself is the most important consideration. Women tend to wait 2-4 hours longer to get help when having a heart attack than men, which would account for the higher death rate.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="floatclear"></div> <div class="modfloat right"> <div id="mod_17887828" class="module moduleImage"> <h2 class="subtitle">Warning Signs</h2> <div id="imgs_17887828"> <div id="img_url_6215161"> <img src="http://s2.hubimg.com/u/6215161_f260.jpg" width="260" height="260" class="half" alt="" title="" /> </div> <div class="caption_half" id="img_desc_6215161"> <div> Source: <a href="http://signsofheartattackinwomen.com/">http://signsofheartattackinwomen.com/</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="modfloat full"> <div id="mod_17887829" class="module moduleText color0"> <h2 class="subtitle">Symptoms of a Heart Attack in Women</h2> <div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_17887829"> <p>While the most common sign of a heart attack is chest discomfort, women often have other symptoms and the chest discomfort is not the most prominent symptom. Symptoms that are common in women are:</p> <ul> <li>Shoulder, upper back, neck, inner arm or elbows, earlobe, jaw or neck pain are not uncommon.</li> <li>Shortness of breath.</li> <li>Profuse sweating.</li> <li>Dizziness or lightheartedness.</li> <li>Unusual fatigue.</li> <li>Unusual headache, particularly when coupled with other symptoms.</li> </ul> <p>Sometime women might feel they have the flu or indigestion, when they are actually having a heart attack. Due to the fact that there is a relatively short time frame for treatment of a heart attack, it is very important to get to an ER.

Interestingly enough the ear lobe creases have been questioned for centuries. Publius Aelius Hadrianys (Hadrian) the emperor of Rome (117-138 CE) fell ill and died at the age of 60. He was sculpted with deep creases in both ear lobes.</p> <p>One thousand patients were examined for ear lobe creases and evaluated for cardiovascular disease. The result revealed a high correlation between the people with creases and heart disease.

My mind is focused and calm when I run. The stress of the day just melts away and I can work through my issues better with a clear mind. Every time I run, I push myself a little further and that accomplishment builds my self-confidence. I feel stronger and improved physically after each run because I know that I just finished something that has made me better. Running challenges you to do more than you ever thought you could do and the strength you gain from meeting that challenge carries over to help you cross the other hurdles in life. </dd> <dt> —Guest FitConvert </dt> </dl> </div> <div id="ua355318"> <h2>Peace within</h2> <dl> <dd> I run for fun as I run daily early in the morning as I feel at peace with life during my run. </dd> <dt> —Guest Wi </dt> </dl> </div> <div id="ua353206"> <h2>prolong possible good health</h2> <dl> <dd> I know death is inevitable but what if you could prolong good health by simply running a few kms a day. I would be fool to let the chance go by. It takes no special talent, or equipment, while the benefits are beyond comprehesion. I will keep running till I can't move my limbs an inch. </dd> <dt> —Guest Kim </dt> </dl> </div> <div id="ua343758"> <h2>Why do you run?</h2> <dl> <dd> I started running just over 10 years ago, I was turning 50 and wanted to celebrate/reward myself. It was one of the toughest things I have ever done yet gave me back all the joy, self worth and dress sizes I thought I would never see again! I also met some great friends and experienced life outside the worn out old box. I still smile every time I run. Hope you enjoy it too. </dd> <dt> —Guest Gomama </dt> </dl> </div> <div id="ua341238"> <h2>Straight A's</h2> <dl> <dd> I just returned to school after a long time (I'm 38). I worked as a bartender for years, was smoking and eating lots of junk. After kicking the smokes, I started running every other morning mainly to relieve stress. I am on a mission to make straight A's this semester and the running just helps me clear my mind, sleep better and retain information. </dd> <dt> —Guest Jay </dt> </dl> </div> <div id="ua337852"> <h2>All of the above</h2> <dl> <dd> I am running for all of the above, including fighting the grief for a lost son. </dd> <dt> —Guest xurxo.duran@gmail.com </dt> </dl> </div> <div id="ua330958"> <h2>I love it</h2> <dl> <dd> I am a recovering Heroin addict and running has become a great way to live my life without the fear of relapse. I have never run for the fun of it and now that is why I run, For the fun of it. I can't even explain how it has changed my life. </dd> <dt> —Guest Eric </dt> </dl> </div> <div id="ua322279"> <h2>all of the above</h2> <dl> <dd> I started running to get beyond just doing the elliptical trainer while watching &quot;Dancing With the Stars&quot;. Once I started, the desire to set new goals--to see progress set in, so I entered a 5K. Now my goal is to run the whole thing and move on to the next level. I'm hooked. </dd> <dt> —Guest roberta </dt> </dl> </div> <div id="ua316100"> <h2>I'm addicted</h2> <dl> <dd> I first started running last year cause I thought it would be good conditioning for basketball. But, after that, I just loved it and whenever I don't get a good run each day, all I can think about is running -- whether I'm in Converse or barefoot. </dd> <dt> —Guest Ceasar </dt> </dl> </div> <div id="ua314107"> <h2>Running helps in so many ways. </h2> <dl> <dd> Starting my mornings with a run puts me on an instant high for the rest of the day. It's great for weight loss, toning, mood boosts and confidence! I run as often as possible-normally about five times a week, and am competing in a sponsered 10k in October. I'm fourteen years old, and a year ago I couldn't run a lap around my school track. Now I'm impressing everyone and have found a really enjoyable hobby, that keeps me fit and active in times when teenage obesity is becoming an extreme issue! :) </dd> <dt> —Guest Giorgia </dt> </dl> </div> <div id="ua302401"> <h2>Confidence</h2> <dl> <dd> In April of this year at 19 years old, I was depressed. Both of my parents were cancer survivors, I had an extremely stressed relationship with my father's wife, and anxiety to succeed at college was slowly taking over my life. Also my not so nice boyfriend told me that my legs were not up to his standards. Not being one to lay down and die, I starting running, I pledged vegan, and while doing so turned my attitude around. I was never fat. In fact, at 5'5 and 118 pounds, I was very thin. But now, even though my weight hasn't changed very much, my body looks great. I can see muscles I never knew I had. I realize that I can do anything. I'm beautiful, smart, and have an extremely high self esteem. I have never felt so powerful as I do when my feet are pounding the pavement. I have become addicted to the feeling of self worth and clarity I get on my daily run. I am so happy I started so young so I can continue running consistently for years to come. Every time I get out there I am decreasing my risk of having the same health issues and I'm giving my boyfriend a big middle finger up. I love the new me. I am so excited to keep increasing my distance ( I'm at a little over 5k now) and increasing my fitness. My anxiety has decreased tremendously. I will never let anyone Make me feel small again. I am a strong, independent woman and no one can take that away. Running saved my mind. </dd> <dt> —Smira09 </dt> </dl> </div> <div id="ua301452"> <h2>Grieving for my son and weight loss</h2> <dl> <dd> My infant son died from Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome less than two months ago. The extra weight is not coming off as quickly as it did with my first child since I'm now unable to continue nursing. Even though I have my family I felt I wanted to die. When I run I don't feel this way; I have a clear head and a purpose. I run at the beach with my daughter in a stroller so I'm getting a great tan and we get to play in the surf afterward. I'm a total beginner runner but am really psyched about my new hobby. </dd> <dt> —Guest Kelly </dt> </dl> </div> <div id="ua252110"> <h2>courage</h2> <dl> <dd> There was a time in my life where I really didn't want to live anymore. I don't know if it was just teenage angst or because I truly didn't have anything worth caring about. Once I began running I realized how much similar it was to life. Races are hard, but they aren't half as tough as they seem if you're willing to be just as hard. It just gives me hope to know that no matter how hard life gets, I always have the option to stand and fight. </dd> <dt> —Guest braden </dt> </dl> </div> <div id="ua201009"> <h2>Change</h2> <dl> <dd> I always hated running long distances my whole life. About two months ago, my friend was having shin pain while we were walking and needed to run. I ran with her and fell in love. I started really running to lose weight. I now run because I'm addicted and it allows me to just...be. </dd> <dt> —Csphinx </dt> </dl> </div> <div id="ua182885"> <h2>Run for Mind and Sexy Body</h2> <dl> <dd> I started running to find a different workout. I run early in the a.m. No one's around -- just me and fresh air and no family or work problems. I love to make the first footprints in the snow in wintertime, too. And, as a plus, my body feels GREAT and SEXY. What more can you want? </dd> <dt> —Guest Tonya </dt> </dl> </div> <div class="pagination"> <span class="prev"><a href="reasonsforrunning.01.htm">Previous</a></span>31-45 of 81 <span class="next"><a href="reasonsforrunning.03.htm">Next</a></span> </div> <form id="ua_form" name="ua_form" method="post" action="http://apps.about.com/cgi-bin/apps/ugc/commentfeeder.cgi" accept-charset="UTF-8"> <fieldset> <input type="hidden" name="iefix" value="1" /> <h3>Share Your Reason</h3> <h2>Why Do You Run?</h2> <fieldset id="lis"> <div> <label for="m_name">Guest Name<em title="Required field">*</em></label> <p id="m_login" class="alert"><a href="http://www.about.com/gi/pages/login.htm?zTt=50&amp;sdn=running" target="modal">Login with Member Name</a> or <a href="http://login.about.com/registration.htm?successurl=http%3A//running.about.com/u/ua/getstartedwithrunning/reasonsforrunning.02.htm&amp;surlanchor=%23lis&amp;cob=running&amp;product=50">Register</a></p> </div> <input id="m_name" name="u" maxlength="40" validate="required" /> <input type="hidden" name="i" id="guid" /> </fieldset> <label for="ua_title">Response Title</label> <input id="ua_title" name="t" maxlength="40" validate="required" /> <label for="ua_answer">Response</label> <textarea id="ua_answer" name="c" validate="minmax" range="50,1000" counter="1"></textarea> <div id="notify"> <label for="m_mail">Email<br /><span class="alert">(optional)</span></label> <input id="m_mail" name="e" type="email" value="" /> <p class="alert">Receive a one-time notification when your response is published.</p> <div class="fbbx"> <input id="fbbox" name="fb" type="checkbox" value="1" /> <label id="fb" for="fbbox">Post my response on Facebook when it's published.</label> </div> </div> <div id="ua_disc" class="alert"> <a href="http://www.about.com/gi/pages/uagree.htm">User Agreement</a> </div> <input type="submit" id="ua_submit" value="Submit" /> <input type="hidden" name="mpt" value="" /> <input type="hidden" name="p" value="128.2.207.79" /> <input type="hidden" name="a" value="Mozilla/5.0 (compatible;

class="verdana9"> The following fact sheet was prepared by the ECAR Center staff. Once prepared, each ECAR Center fact sheet undergoes a review process with the applicable state environmental agency(ies). You can check on the status of the review process <a href="/fs.cfm?st=OH&amp;fs=lead">here</a>. Please read the disclaimer on the status page. While we have tried to present a summary of the essential information on this topic, you should be aware that other items, such as local regulations, may apply to you. </p> <p class="subhead"><b> What You Need to Know</b></p> <p class="verdana10">Battery components are toxic and corrosive. Lead and sulfuric acid can contaminate the air, soil and water. Direct contact with sulfuric acid can burn the skin and eyes. Because exposure to lead in the environment can pose a serious health hazard, used lead acid batteries are hazardous and they have to be handled according to special rules.&nbsp;However, by properly recycling your used lead acid batteries, you can get something of a break from the otherwise very demanding rules that apply to most hazardous wastes.&nbsp;This fact sheet will tell you:</p> <ul> <li class="verdana10">How to handle batteries so that you are not subject to the full scope of Ohio's hazardous waste rules</li> <li class="verdana10">What you need to do to handle batteries in compliance with the rules that apply to you</li> </ul> <hr /> <p class="subhead"><b><a name="regs" id="regs"></a>Regulations</b></p> <p class="verdana10">If you are removing lead acid batteries from vehicles and sending them to a recycling facility, they are not subject to the full scope of Ohio's hazardous waste rules. For batteries that will be recycled, you can manage them under Ohio's existing battery rules in OAC 3745-58-70. Or you can manage them under Ohio's hazardous waste regulations as a &quot;universal waste,&quot; which is a special designation. Both regulations have reduced standards for batteries that will be recycled. </p> <p class="verdana10"> *If you are not recycling lead acid batteries, you must evaluate them before they are disposed of to determine if they are a <a href="/oh/oh-hazwaste.htm">hazardous waste</a>. Because of the lead and acid contained in these batteries, they will likely be a characteristic hazardous waste, and the applicable hazardous waste rules must be followed.</p> <p class="verdana10">Auto recyclers who receive, store, and send batteries off-site for recycle are &quot;universal waste handlers.&quot; There are two groups of handlers, based on the amount of universal waste accumulated on-site at any one time:</p> <ul> <li class="verdana10">Small Quantity Handler of Universal Wastes (SQHUW) - accumulates less than 11,000 lbs. (5,000 kg) of universal waste at any time during a calendar year.</li> <li class="verdana10">Large Quantity Handler of Universal Wastes (LQHUW) - accumulates 11,000 lbs. or more (5,000 kg) of universal waste at any time during the calendar year, which would require the site to have an EPA Identification Number.</li> </ul> <p class="verdana10">Once you trigger the LQHUW status you remain a LQHUW for the rest of the calendar year. However, you re-evaluate your classification at the start of each calendar year.</p> <p class="verdana10"><b>Battery Storage.</b> Always store lead acid batteries in a secured, covered location that is designed to contain leaks and temperature extremes. Keep batteries away from open flames or other ignitable sources. Do not stack lead acid batteries since they may crack and leak acid and other hazardous components, thereby incurring a potential expensive cleanup. Keep batteries off the ground to prevent them from coming in contact with water, which may result in contaminated runoff into creeks and streams. Do not store batteries around inside floor drains or outside stormdrains. </p> <p class="verdana10">Improper storage practices can result in potential violations to the Federal Clean Water Act, as well as violations of state and local water quality laws. </p> <p class="verdana10"><b>Labeling and marking.</b> Waste batteries (i.e., each battery), or a container or tank in which the batteries are contained, must be labeled or marked clearly with any one of the following phrases: &quot;Universal Waste -- Battery(ies),&quot; or &quot;Waste Battery(ies),&quot; or &quot;Used Battery(ies).&quot;</p> <p class="verdana10"><b>Response to releases.</b> Should your batteries leak onto the ground, you must immediately contain all releases and determine whether any material resulting from the release is <a href="/oh/oh-hazwaste.htm">hazardous waste.</a> If so, you must manage the hazardous waste in compliance with all applicable laws.</p> <p class="verdana10"><b>Transportation.</b> A transporter of universal waste is not required to get an identification number or required to obtain a hazardous waste transporter permit from Ohio EPA. A waste manifest is not required either, but a transporter must comply with all applicable US Department of Transportation (US DOT) regulations, including having the shipment properly packaged, labeled, marked, placarded, and transported with the proper shipping papers. Contact US DOT at (517) 377-1866 for more information. A transporter of universal waste is required to deliver the shipment to a universal waste handler, destination facility, or foreign destination. </p> <p class="verdana10"><b>Links to the Regulations. </b>Use the following links to view the regulations pertaining to battery management.</p> <p class="verdana10"><a href="http://www.epa.ohio.gov/dhwm/l_ruwm.aspx">Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) 3745-273 on Universal Waste Management Standards</a></p> <p class="verdana10"><a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_07/40cfr273_07.html">40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 273- RCRA Standards for Universal Waste Management</a></p> <p class="verdana10"><a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_07/40cfr261_07.html">Identification and Listing of Hazardous Waste</a></p> <p class="verdana10"><a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_07/40cfr262_07.html">Part 262 - Standards Applicable to Generators of Hazardous Waste</a></p> <hr /> <p class="subhead"><b><a name="self" id="self"></a>Self-Audit Checklist</b></p> <p class="verdana10">When an inspector comes to your facility, there are certain things he or she checks to see if you are in compliance with environmental regulations. It makes good sense for you to perform a &quot;self-audit&quot; and catch and correct problems before they result in penalties. Also, there are some compliance incentives associated with self-audits (see <a href="http://www.envcap.org/audit/">Audit Policy Page</a>).</p> <p class="verdana10">Use the following list to audit your battery storage and management procedures. </p> <ol> <li class="verdana10"><b>Has the facility made a size determination (SQHUW vs. LQHUW)? </b>Review records and current inventory to verify the size determination was correct. A large quantity handler of universal wastes (LQHUW) is a facility that accumulates 11,000 lbs. or more of all universal wastes at any time during the calendar year. </li> <li class="verdana10"><b>If the facility is a LQHUW, they are required to have an EPA Identification Number.</b> Verify that the facility has an EPA Identification Number. </li> <li class="verdana10"><b>All handlers of universal waste are required to meet specific accumulation time limits.</b> Verify that the facility has a system in place to determine accumulation times and that no used batteries have been on-site for more that one year. </li> <li class="verdana10"><b>All handlers of universal waste are required to manage the batteries and other solid waste generated from battery activities according to specific parameters and procedures.</b> Verify that universal waste batteries are managed in a way that prevents releases of any batteries or battery components to the environment. Verify that batteries that show evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable condition are stored in a container. Verify that containers are closed, structurally sound, compatible with the contents of the battery, and lack evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage. </li> <li class="verdana10"><b>All handlers of universal waste are required to manage releases according to specific procedures.</b> Verify that all releases of waste battery residues are immediately contained. Verify that the handler determines if the material resulting from the release is a hazardous waste. Verify that if the material is hazardous waste, it is handled appropriately in accordance with all applicable RCRA requirements. </li> <li class="verdana10"><b>All employees who handle or have responsibility for managing universal wastes are required to be trained. </b>Verify that all employees have been trained in the proper handling and emergency response procedures relative to their responsibilities during normal facility operations and emergencies. </li> <li class="verdana10"><b>Universal waste batteries are required to be labeled. </b>Verify that universal waste batteries (each battery), or a container in which the batteries are contained, are labeled or marked clearly with any one of the following phrases: </li> </ol> <ul> <ul> <li class="verdana10">UNIVERSAL WASTE BATTERY(IES) </li> <li class="verdana10">WASTE BATTERY(IES) </li> <li class="verdana10">USED BATTERY(IES) </li> </ul> </ul> <hr /> <p class="subhead"><b><a name="bmp" id="bmp"></a>Best Management Practices (BMPs)</b></p> <p class="verdana10">Most regulations tell you what you have to do to be in compliance, but they don’t explain how to do it.

Their headquarters are in New York, USA. It is an international organization known for its extensive preaching and publishing activities, with <em>The Watchtower</em> and <em>Awake!</em> religious magazines and the <em>“New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures”</em> being the most prominent examples.</p> <ul> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#1"><span class="tocnumber">1</span> <span class="toctext">Origins</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#2"><span class="tocnumber">2</span> <span class="toctext">Membership</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#3"><span class="tocnumber">3</span> <span class="toctext">Organizational structure</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#4"><span class="tocnumber">4</span> <span class="toctext">Beliefs and doctrines</span></a> <ul> <li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#4p1"><span class="tocnumber">4.1</span> <span class="toctext">The question of blood</span></a></li> </ul></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#5"><span class="tocnumber">5</span> <span class="toctext">Practices</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#6"><span class="tocnumber">6</span> <span class="toctext">Jehovah’s Witnesses and governments</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#7"><span class="tocnumber">7</span> <span class="toctext">Opposition to Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#8"><span class="tocnumber">8</span> <span class="toctext">Jehovah’s Witnesses and eschatology</span></a> <ul> <li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#8p1"><span class="tocnumber">8.1</span> <span class="toctext">Early eschatology</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#8p2"><span class="tocnumber">8.2</span> <span class="toctext">1975</span></a></li> <li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#8p3"><span class="tocnumber">8.3</span> <span class="toctext">Recent changes</span></a></li> </ul></li> <li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#9"><span class="tocnumber">9</span> <span class="toctext">Jehovah’s Witnesses and their families</span></a></li> </ul> <p><a name="1"></a></p> <h2>Origins</h2> <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that some time after the death of the last apostle, the Church gradually diverged, in a “Great Apostasy”, from the original teachings of Jesus in several major points. Influenced by Restorationism, they believe their faith is a continually improving, imperfect restoration of First Century Christianity. An example in <em>The Watchtower</em> states: “It was the 1900-year-old ‘faithful and discreet slave,’ [parable--Matthew 24:45] the old Christian congregation, that was entrusted with this precious Kingdom service … obedient in its centuries-old commission to be witnesses in the earth … the matured ’slave’ as represented by a remnant now stood ready for new assignments of service.”<span id="ref_w60_0715none" class="reference">(Watchtower 1960)</span> They teach that this new assignment occurred in 1919 in fulfillment of scripture. Jehovah’s Witnesses feel that true understanding of the scriptures began to be reassembled by Charles Taze Russell and his associates when they formed a Bible study group in the 1870s in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, and had until then been imperfectly represented since the Great Apostasy by a number of historical Christian groups.</p> <p>From their beginnings, the “Bible Students” as they were known, focused their evangelizing work on proclaiming that Christ’s Second Presence had begun invisibly in 1874. As part of the dawning of the Millennium, Christ was believed to have been enthroned as King in 1878, and the destruction of religious organizations and governments was expected by the year 1914, to be followed by the establishment of a world-wide paradise. Though their interpretation of prophetic dates has changed through the years, eschatology has remained a major focus. To this day, based on their understanding of Bible chronology, they believe that 1914 marked the beginning of the “End Times”, and that Armageddon is near, which drives the urgency in their preaching work.</p> <p>Born into a Presbyterian family, Russell had nearly lost his faith until it was rekindled by contact with some Second Adventists (one of the spiritual heirs of the Millerites). Adventist ministers Jonas Wendell, George Storrs and George Stetson were early influences. In 1876 Russell met Nelson H. Barbour and subsequently adopted Barbour’s understanding of biblical chronology. Russell provided financial backing for Barbour and became co-editor of Barbour’s magazine <em>Herald of the Morning</em>. Breaking with Barbour in 1879 over the concept of substitutionary atonement, Russell soon began publishing his own magazine <em>Zion’s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ’s Presence</em>. Known as “Pastor Russell”, he formed a legal entity which developed into the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania in 1881, and in 1884 it was incorporated with Russell as president. Over several years, many millions of copies of <em>Zion’s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ’s Presence</em> were distributed in several languages to proclaim Christ’s presence and the dawn of his Millennium. In addition, his six-volume work, originally entitled <em>Millennial Dawn</em> but later changed to <em>Studies in the Scriptures</em>, established the fundamental doctrines derived from their Bible study. (As a consequence, the Bible Students were sometimes called “Millennial Dawnists”.) In 1914 Russell founded the International Bible Students Association in Great Britain.</p> <p>Russell died in 1916, and in the following year, the movement was divided by schisms due to significant doctrinal changes. Those who rejected the changes in organization and doctrine became known as the Associated Bible Students, referring to themselves as simply “Bible Students” to this day. In 1918, a Bible Student convention was held independently of the Watchtower Society. At the second convention, a few months later, the Pastoral Bible Institute was founded and began publishing <em>The Herald of Christ’s Kingdom</em>. The magazine continues to be published today. By 1928 nearly 75% of Bible Students had fled from the changes in place by Pastor Russell&acute;s successor.</p> <p>In 1931, while Russell’s successor, Joseph Franklin Rutherford (often referred to as “Judge Rutherford”), was president of the Watch Tower Society, those who maintained their association with the Society adopted the name “Jehovah’s Witnesses”, based on Isaiah 43:10 which reads, in part: “‘You are my witnesses,’ is the utterance of Jehovah…” (<em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</em>).</p> <p>Under Rutherford, Jehovah’s Witnesses experienced rapid growth. Rutherford was known for bold rhetoric. In his preaching, he coined the phrase “Religion is a snare and a racket,” heavily denouncing the Catholic Church and Christendom generally, modern Judaism and national governments. Under his leadership, the Society developed a legal staff (which is utilized to this day), and battled successfully in US and Canadian courts to establish their rights to preach their religion. These legal battles resulted in significant improvements in freedom of speech and religion in the laws of both countries. (See, e.g., <em>Cantwell v. State of Connecticut</em>, <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire</em>, <em>West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette</em>.)</p> <p>Nathan Homer Knorr became president of the Watch Tower Society after Rutherford’s death in 1942. Known as an efficient administrator, Knorr emphasized ministerial training in the local congregations and also founded the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead for training missionaries. Knorr’s Vice-President Frederick William Franz became the chief theologian for the Witnesses and was credited as being the principal translator of the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</em> Witness membership rose from 115,000 to over 2 million under Knorr’s leadership.</p> <p>The leadership of Jehovah’s Witnesses was reorganized in 1975 and the power of the presidency passed on to the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Subsequent presidents of the Watch Tower Society after Knorr’s death in 1977 have been Frederick William Franz, Milton George Henschel and Don A. Adams. However, doctrinal and organizational decisions since 1975 have been made by the Governing Body.</p> <p><a name="2"></a></p> <h2>Membership</h2> <p>As of August 2005, Jehovah’s Witnesses have a practicing membership of more than 6.6 million, according to data reported in the Annual Worldwide Statistics at the Authorized Site of the Office of Public Information of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The site states: “While other religious groups count their membership by occasional or annual attendance, this figure reflects only those who are actively involved in the public Bible educational work.” Jehovah’s Witnesses have a custom of counting their membership by ‘Lands’ rather than by countries, indicating separate statistics for regions administered by other countries, such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Taiwan.</p> <p>These statistics are based on the number of “active members”. To be classed as an active member (or publisher), an individual who has first been approved as a publisher must serve at least one hour per month in the preaching work, or 15 minutes per month for elderly members and those otherwise physically restricted. Figures for time spent per month are reported by each publisher and submitted monthly to the Society. In 2004, these reports indicated a total of 1.3 billion hours.</p> <p>In the United States, an academic study at CUNY based on a telephone survey (American Religious Identification Survey) was conducted in 2001 and estimated there to be 1.331 million adults in the U.S. who self-identify as Jehovah’s Witnesses <span id="ref_USCensus.2003none" class="reference">(U.S. Census Bureau 2003)</span>. Jehovah’s Witnesses report over 1 million active publishers in the United States, but because this includes minors, it is not directly comparable to the ARIS numbers. In 1990, a larger but less detailed telephone survey based study (NSRI) at CUNY reported 1.38 million adults in the U.S. who self-identified as Jehovah’s Witnesses. While this might indicate a slow decline in U.S. identification with the group, there was an increase in active U.S. publishers over this period. ARIS notes the survey did not cover non-English speakers and small groups with a high proportion of recent immigrant members were likely undercounted. Announced U.S. Witness convention schedules for 2005 include 75 non-English conventions of 227 total. Most increase in membership each year is due to an influx of non-English speaking individuals, with a rapid increase in foreign-language congregations being established throughout the country.</p> <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses have a small active presence in most countries and are the second or third largest religious group in many countries with a dominant religion. In no country are they a large part of the population, however. Brazil and Mexico are the only countries other than the U.S. where the number of active Witness publishers exceeds 0.5 million. The highest proportion of Witnesses in a country of substantial size is in Zambia, where 1% are active Witness publishers. Growth in most developed countries is slow or negative in recent years but is offset by rapid growth in less developed lands, particularly the former Communist bloc and Latin America.</p> <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses commemorate the Memorial of Christ’s death (also known as the Lord’s Evening Meal) annually. According to the February 1, 2006 <em>Watchtower</em>, worldwide attendance at the 2005 celebration of the Memorial was 16,383,333, slightly lower than the 2004 attendance of 16,760,607. This figure includes not only publishers, but inactive members, relatives, visitors and interested persons. In the U.S., 2.3 million people were present. In Zambia 570,000 attended, or 1 person for every 22 in the population. Of over 16 million in attendance worldwide, only 8,524 persons partook of the memorial emblems of unleavened bread and wine. These are those who profess to be anointed ones based on their interpretation of Revelation 14:1. <span id="ref_JWStats_MP.2004anone" class="reference">(Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society 2004a)</span></p> <p><a name="3"></a></p> <h2>Organizational structure</h2> <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses are currently led by a small, ecclesiastical Governing Body. Jehovah’s Witnesses believe the role of the Governing Body corresponds to that of those who met in the Council of Jerusalem, guided by Holy Spirit and directed by Jesus. The description of the Council of Jerusalem in the Acts of the Apostles is often used as an example of how God had a “visible organization” in the first century. From this they reason that God therefore has an organization today. This top-down leadership is referred to by the Witnesses as “theocratic”.</p> <p>All members of the Governing Body profess to be “anointed”. The number of men who make up the Governing Body has ranged from ten to seventeen. Since April 1975, the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses makes decisions by a two-thirds majority vote; previously a unanimous vote was required. Therefore, no one member makes decisions nor asserts any more spiritual insight than any other member of the Governing Body. (Raymond Franz, <em>Crisis of Conscience</em>, pp. 45, 85, 163) The Governing Body (indirectly through the departments of its various legal organizations) directs the operation of the 111 branches spread throughout the world <span id="ref_JWStats.2005none" class="reference">(Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society 2005)</span>. Each branch has appointed overseers who travel among various local congregations, spending a week with each and giving spiritual encouragement through talks and one-on-one time spent with members in their public ministry. Within each local congregation, appointed elders organize the congregation’s public ministry, and the content and schedule of their five weekly meetings, based on publications and precedents set by the Governing Body. They also recommend, via a vote of the elder body, “spiritually mature” baptized male members of the congregation for the positions of elder or ministerial servant, requiring the approval of higher leadership.</p> <p>Elders take the lead in congregational matters, particularly in religious instruction and spiritual counseling, whereas the ministerial servants assist elders in a limited administrative capacity, and they and other Witnesses ‘in good standing’ often perform the majority of operational tasks for congregation meetings.</p> <p>Witnesses do not consider elders to be clergy, though their service includes pastoral activity that clergy provide in other Christian denominations. All baptized Witnesses are considered to be ordained ministers, and are obligated to provide religious instruction to others. Spiritually mature Witnesses (men and women alike) are exhorted to the counseling of less-mature Witnesses. They may be assigned a newer publisher to assist in ministry, and may be asked to conduct a personal Bible study with another Witness who is spiritually troubled or “weak”. Males are encouraged to reach out for ‘privileges of service’ such as becoming elders. Elders are said to be worthy of “double honor”, but are held to a higher standard as overseers than other baptized “publishers”, and are subject to additional discipline including removal. An elder may also be removed, or choose to step down willingly, from his position if members of his household are not in “good standing”.</p> <p>About 8,500 other Jehovah’s Witnesses profess to be anointed but they have no formal role in establishment or modification of the doctrines of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Unless appointed into one of the various roles described above, they have no position of leadership or authority. Women who profess to be anointed cannot attain any position of earthly authority; Witnesses do believe that all anointed, including many women, will be resurrected to heaven to serve as ‘kings and priests’ over other creatures provided they die faithful. They believe that the resurrection of the anointed began in the Spring of 1918 and each member of the anointed who dies since then is resurrected to spirit life in the heavens immediately upon their death.</p> <p><a name="4"></a></p> <h2>Beliefs and doctrines</h2> <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses claim reliance on the Bible for their theology, and the scriptures noted below are commonly used by Witnesses and their organization as the basis for their claims of a biblical foundation for their doctrines. Many beliefs and practices are similar to mainstream Christian denominations, yet there are significant differences as well.</p> <p><strong>Beliefs and practices that can be said to be distinctive of Jehovah’s Witnesses include</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Prominent use of the biblical name of God as translated into native languages, for example: Jehovah in English, Geova in Italian, etc. (based on Psalm 83:18)</li> <li>Jesus is a created being and God’s first creation, not the uncreated second person of the Trinity; Jesus was used by God to create every other creation (based on Colossians 1:15; Proverbs 8:30; Revelation 3:14)</li> <li>Jesus was known as the Archangel Michael in his pre-human existence; his birth on earth was accomplished when God transferred Michael’s life force from heaven to the womb of the virgin Mary (based on Daniel 12:1; John 1:14, 18, 34)</li> <li>The Holy Spirit is God’s ‘active force’, not the uncreated third person of the Trinity (based on Acts 2:1-4)</li> <li>Preaching from “house to house” (based on Acts 5:42; 20:20, 21)</li> <li>Only Jehovah’s Witnesses can correctly be called true Christians (<em>Watchtower</em> December 1, 1992 pp. 16-17 paragraphs 18-22; <em>The Road to Everlasting Life—Have You Found It?</em> Part 7 “Who Practice the True Religion?”)</li> <li>Deceased redeemable individuals are “asleep in death” awaiting the “resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous” (based on Acts 24:15)</li> <li>The number of Christians going to heaven is limited to precisely 144,000 where they will rule with Jesus as kings and priests over Earth (based on Revelation 7:4-8; 14:1-4; 20:6)</li> <li>Jesus is mediator for those in the ‘new covenant’ (the 144,000) (based on Hebrews 8:6); no one comes to the Father except though Jesus. (based on John 14:6)</li> <li>Teaching authority is only possessed by a ‘Governing Body’ (currently comprised of 12 men) who have the equivalent of magisterium regarding interpretation of the Bible, also referred to as the Faithful and Discreet Slave (based on Acts 2:41, 42; 15:1-31; 16:4, 5)</li> <li>The Greek Scriptures are directed primarily to the 144,000, (though the principles apply to all members) (<em>United In Worship of the Only True God</em>; 1983, p. 111)</li> <li>The Temple of Jerusalem was destroyed in 607 BC, rather than the historically accepted date of 587/586 BC, based on the belief that 70 years transpired from destruction of Jerusalem to return of captives from Babylon (based on Jer. 29:10, Dan. 9:2)</li> <li>The “seven times” of Daniel 4:10-17 are interpreted as a 2,520 year period from 607 BC to 1914 AD, referred to as the “Gentile Times” (based on Luke 21:24)</li> <li>Jesus’ invisible enthronement as King of Heaven in 1914 was followed by an inspection period of all Christian Churches, and Jehovah’s Witnesses were chosen by Jesus in 1919 as the only true Christian organization (based on Revelation 18:2-5; <em>Watchtower</em> May 1, 1993 p. 16, 17 paragraphs 4-8)</li> <li>In 1918 Jesus resurrected those of the 144,000 (the “anointed”) who had already died to heavenly life; since 1918, any “anointed” are individually resurrected to heavenly life at the time of their death (based on Revelation 6:11, 14:13; <em>Revelation–It’s Grand Climax At Hand!</em>, page 102)</li> <li>A “Great Crowd” of Jehovah’s Witnesses is now living that will survive the coming battle of Armageddon and have the prospect of living forever in an earthly paradise (based on Revelation 7:9-17)</li> <li>Celebration of the Lord’s Supper is held once a year after sundown on the date corresponding to Nisan 14 on the Hebrew calendar; only those claiming to be of the “remnant” of the 144,000 with the heavenly hope partake of the unleavened bread and wine (those with the earthly hope attend but do not partake)”The only flesh saved” at Armageddon will be faithful Jehovah’s Witnesses—these being just the “anointed” and the “great crowd”, according to the vast majority of the Governing Body’s approved publications through the Watch Tower Society. (<em>Watchtower</em> magazines 15 November 1983, p.24; 15 June 1999, p.6; <em>Live Forever</em> book, p.255) A few other Witness publications do not comment either way about individuals at Armageddon who are uninformed of Jehovah’s Witnesses’ message. These publications leave the fate of these people in “God’s hands”; whether or not they might be spared destruction is left inconclusive in those publications.

The authors of the book <em>Reasoning from the Scriptures</em> state that “they do not resort to philosophical arguments to evade [the bible's] clear statements of truth.” (<em>Reasoning from the Scriptures</em> p. 204). Yet, in the book <em>Is There a Creator Who Cares about You?</em> the authors explicate several well known philosophical proofs for the existence of God. (See <em>Is There a Creator Who Cares about You</em>? pp. 17, 25, 78). The authors use the Fine-Tuning argument, the Teleological argument, and the Kalam Cosmological argument to support belief in God.</p> <p><a name="4p1"></a></p> <h3>The question of blood</h3> <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses reject whole allogeneic blood transfusions.<span id="ref_JW_hb.2004bnone" class="reference">(Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society 2004b)</span> This is based on their understanding of the biblical admonition to “keep abstaining from blood” (based on Acts 15:28, 29). Prior to 2000, the storage and use of human and animal blood products, and the commercial use of blood products were condemned as unscriptural. (<em>Watchtower</em> 1 February 1997 p.30)</p> <p>Although Jehovah’s Witnesses do not accept transfusions of whole blood, and despite not donating blood (as they believe it must not be stored), they may according to the conscience of the particular individual, accept derivatives of blood, or even whole autologous blood so long as it is part of a “current therapy”, such as normovolemic hemodilution, a treatment that processes the individual’s own blood in a closed loop that does not interrupt the flow of blood, delivering it immediately back into the person’s body. Also left to conscience are procedures where a “quantity of blood is withdrawn in order to tag it or to mix it with medicine, whereupon it is put back into the patient.” (15 October 2000 <em>Watchtower</em>, p. 31)</p> <p>The Witnesses’ Medical Care and Blood policy changed fundamentally in the year 2000 and now accepts derivatives such as Hemopure, which consists of chemically stabilized bovine hemoglobin (derived from cows’ blood) and PolyHeme (chemically modified hemoglobin derived from human blood). The Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, PA, provides a detailed list of these specific distinctions. Witnesses interpret the prohibited use of blood to be limited to whole allogeneic blood (or any of its four main components), or stored autologous blood. Transfusion of whole autologous blood that is part of a “current therapy” and/or sufficiently fractionated constituents from donated and stored allogeneic blood are considered a “gray area” not specifically condemned and therefore permissable. (15 June 2000 <em>Watchtower</em>, pp. 29-31)</p> <p>Many Jehovah’s Witnesses carry carefully prepared durable power of attorney documents indicating that they will accept all fractions derived from blood. The wording of this option reads, <em>“I accept all fractions derived from any primary component of blood.”</em> (2003 Guide to Our Three Health Care Documents, p. 11) The conscience of some Witnesses still does not permit the use of fractions derived from blood and these will use non-blood alternatives with varying degrees of success.</p> <p>The refusal of blood transfusions is a significant issue among medical professionals and others concerning Jehovah’s Witnesses, especially when it involves minor children and more so in view of the fact that children of Jehovah’s Witnesses have died as a consequence. In some countries, laws may impose limitations on physicians on the ability to withhold or withdraw blood transfusions or blood therapy from minors, particularly in life-threatening situations; parents who have prevented children under their care from receiving blood therapy in life-threatening situations may face prosecution. Courts have ordered transfusions for some children, often the very young; in other cases they have respected the declared choice of an under-age minor who is able to defend his or her own beliefs to the court in a manner that reflects a mature understanding and without undue influence from the parents.</p> <p>Pursuit of medical alternatives to blood transfusion in cases involving Jehovah’s Witness patients, including the use of erythropoietin to boost the red blood cell count, has afforded opportunities for medical advancement in the field of bloodless surgery.<span id="ref_JW_SurgicalAdvances.1996none" class="reference">(Awake! 1996)</span></p> <p>A peer-reviewed essay entitled, “Jehovah’s Witnesses, Blood Transfusions, and the Tort of Misrepresentation,” found in the Autumn issue of Baylor University’s Journal of Church and State, published December 13, 2005, discusses the potential vulnerability of Jehovah’s Witnesses’ legal corporations to significant claims for compensation because of the religion’s possible misrepresentation of the medical risks of blood transfusions.</p> <p><a name="5"></a></p> <h2>Practices</h2> <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses have five meetings per week, which are made up of five program parts (totaling approximately five hours). Meetings are held in local Kingdom Halls and private homes. Larger conventions are held usually three times a year in facilities owned or maintained by the Watchtower Society or rented, such as stadiums or auditoriums. Throughout the week, there are also meetings for “field service” (preaching work) where members meet either in homes, or the Kingdom Hall, to organize and pray prior to engaging in door-to-door or other forms of evangelism. On a daily basis, Jehovah’s Witnesses are encouraged to meditate on spiritual matters, often by aids such as <em>Examining the Scriptures Daily,</em> a booklet with a scripture from the Bible and commentary usually based on a <em>Watchtower</em> article. Before meals, Jehovah’s Witnesses commonly say a prayer, either silently when alone or aloud when at a gathering.</p> <p>Aside from their worship practices, Jehovah’s Witnesses are identifiable by things from which they abstain. There is a general avoidance of practices considered to have nationalistic or “false religious” roots. These can be such things as singing the national anthem at sporting events, or not saying “bless you” when someone sneezes. They avoid celebrations of birthdays and holidays. Their only officially mandated celebration is the “Memorial of Christ’s Death.” Weddings, anniversaries, and memorials at death are also optionally observed. Adhering to these standards of behavior, Jehovah’s Witnesses believe themselves to be faithful even in the seemingly small things (see Luke 16:10). The use of distinctive titles in address (such as Father, Pastor, Elder, Reverend, etc. among other groups) is strictly avoided (Matthew 23:6-12). All Witnesses, irrespective of privileges of service, address one another as “Brother” or “Sister”, often followed by the first or last name of the individual. There are categories of privileges of service (Pioneer, Elder, Presiding Overseer, and so on) which may be used to refer to an individual in reference to those duties (”John is an elder”), but never as a title or to address him or her (”elder John”).</p> <p>Their view of sexual behavior reflects conservative Christian views, such as pre-marital sex and homosexual acts as being violations of God’s law. “Modesty” is heavily encouraged in daily dress, especially at spiritual events, where standards of dress are more formal, varying by country and regional custom (In the U.S., Europe, and most of Asia, this typically consists of formal western business attire). In addition, entertainment with sexual, materialistic, spiritualistic or violent subject matter is strongly discouraged. Further, though they are nonconformists in some ways, they seek not to appear to be “counter-cultural.” They avoid presenting an image that might appear unkempt or unprofessional according to local culture and societal norms. Therefore, in certain areas, styles or attributes such as beards, long hair or earrings for men, or any dress or grooming for both men and women that is defined by them to appear “rebellious” or “immodest” are seriously discouraged, even outside of spiritual activities. A person violating these standards would risk providing a “bad witness,” and would fail to mark him or herself as different from the secular and “false religious” world. This is in keeping with their interpretation of the scriptural admonition at 2 Timothy 2:9,10 (<em>NWT</em>), “Likewise I desire the women to adorn themselves in well-arranged dress, with modesty and soundness of mind, not with styles of hair braiding and gold or pearls or very expensive garb, but in the way that befits women professing to reverence God, namely, through good works.” Jehovah’s Witnesses consider this admonition to apply, in principle, equally to men and to women.</p> <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses are known in many lands for their building work. International and regional building teams frequently undertake so-called “quick builds,” construction of Kingdom Halls over the course of one or two weekends. Larger construction projects, including the building of regional Assembly Halls and Bethel offices, factories, residences, warehouses, and farm facilities, are also carried out almost entirely by volunteer members.</p> <p>The Witnesses are noted for their racial and ethnic integration. In the United States an academic study (ARIS 2001) by CUNY put the proportion of blacks among adults who self-identified as Witnesses at 37% (the highest proportion among any of the 22 largest religious identifications which make up 90% of the U.S. population). Congregations are generally organized geographically, and members are encouraged to attend the Kingdom Hall in whose territory they reside, resulting in an ethnic mix generally representative of local population. Anecdotal accounts of Witness outreach across racial lines are a common subject matter for the annual <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses</em>. A notable example is the account of relief efforts to both Hutu and Tutsi Witnesses and non-Witnesses during the genocide in Rwanda and to Congo refugees. “Since 1994, Jehovah’s Witnesses in Europe alone have sent more than 190 tons of food, clothing, medicine, and other relief supplies to the Great Lakes region of Africa.” This humanitarian aid was not given exclusively to Jehovah’s Witnesses. Others also benefited. For instance, the Witnesses distributed medicine and clothing to several primary schools and an orphanage near Goma.<span id="ref_jw_rwanda.1998none" class="reference">(Watchtower 1998a)</span></p> <p><a name="6"></a></p> <h2>Jehovah’s Witnesses and governments</h2> <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses exhort their members to obey all the laws, including the paying of taxes, of the country in which they reside, so long as these do not violate ‘God’s law’. This is in keeping with their interpretation of Romans 13:7:</p> <dl> <dd> <dl> <dd> Render to all their dues, to him who calls for the tax, the tax; to him who calls for the tribute, the tribute; to him who calls for fear, such fear; to him who calls for honor, such honor. </dd> </dl> </dd> </dl> <p>At the same time, however, they hold a stance of political neutrality. Examples of this detachment in practice include:</p> <ul> <li>Refusal to salute the flag, or sing nationalistic songs</li> <li>Refusal to serve in the military (including defense, or non-combatant roles)</li> <li>Refusal to participate in political processes including democratic ones: voting in government elections, while termed a ‘conscience decision’ for legal reasons, constitutes an act of disassociation, as does military service. (<em>Watchtower</em> 1 November 1999 pp.28-9)</li> <li>Refusal to hold political office</li> </ul> <p>One area in which Jehovah’s Witnesses have influenced public policy is civil rights. The Watch Tower Society from the days of Joseph Franklin Rutherford has utilized the court systems of various countries to defend religious freedoms. In addition, they have occasionally organized letter-writing campaigns to protest “persecutions”, most famously those addressed to Adolf Hitler during the second world war and certain African nations during the 1970s. (See the publication <em>Defending and Legally Establishing the Good News</em> for examples.)</p> <p>According to the book <em>Judging Jehovah’s Witnesses</em> (Shawn Francis Peters, University Press of Kansas: 2000), the Witnesses have helped to widen the definition of civil liberties in most western societies, hence broadening the rights of millions of people, due to their firm stand and determination. According to the preface to the book <em>State and Salvation</em> (William Kaplan, University of Toronto Press: 1989): “One of the results of the Witnesses’ legal battles was the long process of discussion and debate that led to the Charter of Rights, which is now part of the fundamental law of Canada. Other battles in countries around the world have involved the rights to decline military service or martial arts training, to decline to participate in political parties or governmental elections, to exercise free and anonymous speech, to exercise freedom of association, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, medical self-determination, etc. Witnesses continue to, in their words, ‘defend and legally establish the Good News’ around the world.”</p> <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses endured intense persecution under the Nazi regime from 1933 to 1945, both as a religious group and individually. Unlike Jews, Sinti and Roma (”Gypsies”), persecuted and killed by virtue of their culture, Jehovah’s Witnesses had the opportunity to escape persecution and personal harm by renouncing their religious beliefs. The courage the vast majority displayed in refusing to do so, in the face of torture, maltreatment in concentration camps, and sometimes execution, won them the respect of many contemporaries. These events are recounted in a documentary (available through the Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society) called: PURPLE TRIANGLES. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</p> <p>Regarding the intensity and argumentation used by Jehovah’s Witnesses as an organization in defending their claimed basic “legal rights, Human Rights, and Freedoms of Speech” within the nations in which they have a presence, some criticism has been expressed regarding the internal organizational practices and their effects on the same Human Rights and basic freedoms of individual members. Citing a Witness publication, the contention is that divergent views expressed, or even just thoughts rejecting non-scholarly organizational doctrines by baptized members, will result in disfellowshipping (excommunication), or strong threats thereof on the grounds of “apostasy” with accompanying removal of congregational privileges, communication with family and friends, and respected name and reputation: “Persons who deliberately spread (stubbornly hold to and speak about) teachings contrary to Bible truth as taught by Jehovah’s Witnesses are apostates.” (<em>Pay Attention to Yourselves and to All the Flock</em> p. 94 <em>Apostasy</em>). Also, “Keep in mind that to be disfellowshipped, an apostate does not have to be a promoter of apostate views. . . Therefore, if a baptized Christian abandons the teachings of Jehovah, as presented by the faithful and discreet slave [Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses], and persists in believing other doctrines, . . .then he is apostatizing. . . if he continues to believe the apostate ideas and rejects what has been provided through the ’slave class’ [Governing Body] then appropriate judicial action should be taken.”—letter to all Circuit and District overseers, 1 September 1980. This is seen by some critics as a major restriction of the basic humans rights and freedoms of speech and thought of the members — rights which the organization demands in its legal battles with some governments of the world — as well as indicative of a severe mind- and speech-controlling policy directly contradicting scriptural precedents. They criticize the organization’s pursuit of its rights before governments as hypocritical because they see the organization violating those same rights when dealing with members. The organization sees this as a perfectly reasonable private internal matter by itself and its followers, and states its right to excommunicate members.</p> <p><a name="7"></a></p> <h2>Opposition to Jehovah’s Witnesses</h2> <p>Throughout their history, their beliefs, doctrines and practices have met controversy and opposition from governments, communities, and religious groups. Many Christian denominations consider the interpretation and doctrines of Jehovah’s Witnesses to be heresy. In addition, governments of various political persuasions have considered the religion to be a subversive organization, and sometimes even a threat to national security.</p> <p>Political and religious animosity against them has at times led to mob action and government oppression.</p> <p>On the milder side, there have been opposition by locals to the building of facilities (such as Kingdom Halls), and the holding of large conventions. In those circumstances, at times the reason is opposition to the religion, but at other times, they are more mundane, such as concerns about traffic congestion and noise. In some legal cases, (such as <em>Congr&eacute;gation des t&eacute;moins de J&eacute;hovah de St-J&eacute;r&ocirc;me-Lafontaine v. Lafontaine (Village)</em>), disputes that have actually been about appropriate land use have been claimed by the Witnesses to be a violation of their religious freedoms.</p> <p><a name="8"></a></p> <h2>Jehovah’s Witnesses and eschatology</h2> <p>Since their formation in the 1870s, leaders of the organization have sought to identify dates for end-time events such as the enthronement of Jesus as King, the return of Jesus Christ, and for the “end of this system of things,” culminating in Armageddon. The Witness publication <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses–Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom</em>, gives an overview of some of the historical development of the Witnesses’ eschatology. However, no detailed study by Witness historians has been published. Most information on Jehovah’s Witnesses’ eschatology has been produced by non-Witnesses citing Watch Tower publications. Responding to the charge of being “false prophets,” the Watchtower Society has defended failed predictions, and eschatology changes, as incorrect interpretations of the Bible and views it as evidence that they have been “keeping on the watch” for the “Day of Jehovah.” The Witnesses still rely on their understanding of Bible chronology for establishing the year of Christ’s return. While they look to modern events as corresponding to Biblical prophecies and feel Armageddon is imminent, they no longer predict a specific year for it.</p> <p><a name="8p1"></a></p> <h3>Early eschatology</h3> <p>The Second Adventists affiliated with Nelson H. Barbour expected a visible and dramatic return of Christ in 1873, and later in 1874. They agreed with other Adventist groups that the “time of the end” (also called the “last days”) had started in 1799. Soon after the 1874 disappointment, Barbour accepted the idea that Christ had actually returned to the earth in 1874, but invisibly. 1874 was considered the end of 6,000 years of human history and the beginning of judgment by Christ. Charles Taze Russell and the group that later was known as Bible Students accepted these views from Barbour. Russell taught that while Jesus was invisibly present here on earth, he was made its King in 1878. Russell also taught that in 1878 Christ resurrected all the “dead in Christ” as spirit beings to be with him here on the earth awaiting a future glorification. (As each of the remainder of the 144,000 would die after 1878, Christ would resurrect them as spirit beings to join those already resurrected.) Together with Christ here on earth, these invisible resurrected spirit beings were engaged in directing a harvest work gathering the remainder of those with the heavenly calling. This harvest would run from 1874–1914, and the culmination of Armageddon would occur in 1914 preceded by the gathering of all the saints (both resurrected and living) to heaven notes C1. From 1925–1933, the Watchtower Society radically changed their beliefs after the failure of expectations for Armageddon in 1914, 1915, 1918, 1920, and 1925. In 1925, the <em>Watchtower</em> explained a major change that Christ had now been enthroned as King in heaven in the year 1914 instead of 1878. 1874 was retained as the time of Christ’s invisible return until the early 1930s. But, Christ’s Second Advent was now explained not as a return to the earth but as a “turning of attention” to the earth with Christ remaining in heaven. By 1933, it was clearly taught that Christ had returned invisibly in 1914 and the “last days” had also begun then. The 1878 resurrection date was transferred to 1918 but it was now held these were raised as spirit creatures to heavenly life to be with Christ there. These are the current teachings of Jehovah’s Witnesses regarding 1914 and 1918. Witnesses no longer consider the dates 1799, 1874 and 1878 of any significance today, even though they were foundation doctrines in their time. The idea that the “great tribulation” had begun in 1914 and was “cut short” in 1918 to be resumed at Armageddon was dropped in 1969, though Armageddon is still considered to be “very close”.</p> <p>Other dates proclaimed to be time of God’s judgment on humankind and the culmination of Armageddon, were 1915, 1918, 1920, 1925 and 1941. The return of Old Testament men including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob was an event anticipated by many Jehovah’s Witnesses in 1925 based on writings in their journal, <em>The Watchtower</em>, the book <em>Millions Now Living Will Never Die</em> C2, and various other Watch Tower Society publications. In 1929, Joseph Rutherford (the second president of the Watch Tower) built a luxury villa in California called <em>Beth Sarim</em> for the purpose of housing ancient Biblical persons, who were expected to be physically resurrected on earth to join Christ’s reign over the earth, even though they had failed to materialize as he had predicted for 1925. Rutherford lived in the villa until his death in 1942, and in 1948 the villa was sold. notes C3</p> <p>Throughout its history the Watch Tower Society’s claims authority as “God’s Prophet”, and “God’s one and only true channel to mankind” has been historically reinforced into the minds of Jehovah’s Witnesses throughout the history of the organization. Its dates for Armageddon were repeatedly classed as “of God,”, “God’s time to act against mankind”, “God’s interpretations,” and the organization describes itself in a unique and privileged position of “God’s one sole channel to Mankind” in giving these dates. To questions the dates validity is often negatively inferred to be questioning God Himself. The organization has at times denied being “directly inspired”, but has also made multiple claims equaling inspiration in their import. These historical dates were never suggested to be the thoughts of imperfect men, or passing theories of men at the time of their publishing. This is demonstrated clearly in two out of many issues of the <em>Watchtower</em> magazine published by Jehovah’s Witnesses: “It is on the basis of such and so many correspondences-in accordance with the soundest laws known to science that we affirm that, Scripturally, scientifically, and historically, present-truth chronology is correct beyond a doubt. Its reliability has been abundantly confirmed by the dates and events of 1874, 1914, and 1918. Present-truth chronology is a secure basis on which the consecrated child of God may endeavor to search out things to come.” (<em>Watchtower</em>, 15 June 1922, p. 187.) “This chronology is not of man, but of God. Being of divine origin and divinely corroborated, present-truth chronology stands in a class by itself, absolutely and unqualifiedly correct.”—<em>Watchtower</em>, 15 July 1922, p. 217.</p> <p><a name="8p2"></a></p> <h3>1975</h3> <p>During the 1960s and early 1970s, many Witnesses were stimulated by articles in their literature C4 and further encouraged by speakers at their assemblies prior to 1975, to believe that Armageddon and Christ’s thousand-year millennial reign would begin by 1975. Although the views of Armageddon and Christ’s millennium beginning in 1975 were never fully or explicitly supported by the Watch Tower Society, many in the organizations’ writing department, as well as several leading Witnesses, Elders, and presiding overseers in the organization, heavily suggested that Christ’s millennial reign over earth would begin by 1975. One outstanding example is an audio of a lecture by then Vice-President Fred Franz in early 1975 pin-pointing after sundown on September 5, 1975 as the end of 6,000 years and saying all the prophecies “could happen” by then, while admitting that looked improbable. While Witnesses have always been encouraged to increase the preaching work, and avoid secular life goals or careers, this emphasis was especially strong prior to 1975.</p> <p>Some Witnesses gave up good jobs, notes C5 college, scholarships, and some imprudently sold their houses in the hopeful expectation that God’s Kingdom would literally be established on earth in 1975 after the biblical Armageddon, encouraged by the Watch Tower Society: “Reports are heard of brothers selling their homes and property and planning to finish out the rest of their days in this old system in the pioneer service. Certainly this is a fine way to spend the short time remaining before the wicked world’s end.-1 John 2:17.” notes C6 It is worth noting that similar language persists in publications of Jehovah’s Witnesses, who still hold that the time remaining in the present system is relatively short, and that having an active share in the preaching work is the best use of a believer’s time. Some Jehovah’s Witnesses irresponsibly ran up debt believing they would not to have to pay it back, and some unwisely spent their life savings believing that the 1975 date was a certain and unchangeable fact due to the many encouraging Watch Tower articles. C7 In spite of the Watch Tower Society’s previous admonition that Witnesses should let <em>nothing</em> cause them to tire and give out (<em>Watchtower,</em> 15 August 1968, p. 501), there were many who left the organization (or became inactive) due to the disappointment of Armageddon not coming in 1975, although the majority remained. The large numbers leaving or becoming inactive were seen as baptisms continued at over 100,000 per year (around 200,000 in 1976). However, the organization still continued to lose more members than it gained for several years after 1975, until 1979 when numbers started to recover and increase again.</p> <p>In 1980, the Society acknowledged some responsibility of the 1975 incident. “With the appearance of the book <em>Life Everlasting-in Freedom of the Sons of God</em>, and its comments as to how appropriate it would be for the millennial reign of Christ to parallel the seventh millennium of man’s existence, considerable expectation was aroused regarding the year 1975. There were statements made then, and thereafter, stressing that this was only a possibility. Unfortunately, however, along with such cautionary information, there were other statements published that implied that such realization of hopes by that year was more of a probability than a mere possibility. It is to be regretted that these latter statements apparently overshadowed the cautionary ones and contributed to a build up of the expectation already initiated.” — The <em>Watchtower</em> magazine, 15 March 1980 p.17</p> <p><a name="8p3"></a></p> <h3>Recent changes</h3> <p>In 1995 changes regarding their understanding of the statement “this generation” made by Jesus were published. During the previous four decades, Jehovah’s Witnesses had taught that Jesus was referring to the generation living in 1914, which would not die before Armageddon came. “Those persons yet remaining of that generation are now very old. However, some of them will still be alive to see the end of this wicked system.” (<em>You Can Live Forever In Paradise On Earth</em>, published 1982, rev. 1989, p154).</p> <p>Previously, the proper interpretation of the word “generation” itself was believed to be “beyond question, that which takes a ‘generation’ in the ordinary sense…or for those who are living at the given period.” The belief was that “from 1914 a generation shall not pass till all is fulfilled, and amidst a great time of trouble.”<span class="reference"><sup id="ref_wt_1951_0701a">[a]</sup></span></p> <p>As the generation of 1914 dwindled in numbers, the Society used this for many decades as evidence that the end was “very near and immediately impending.” This doctrine was discarded when the youngest had reached 80 years of age. A “new light” interpretation of “this generation” was then published in <em>The Watchtower</em> magazine of 1 November 1995.<span id="ref_wt_wg.1995anone" class="reference">(Watchtower 1995a)</span></p> <p>The Witnesses’ current teaching regarding the meaning of the term “this generation” is that “in the final fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy today, ‘this generation’ apparently refers to the peoples of earth who see the sign of Christ’s presence but fail to mend their ways.”<span id="ref_wt_attka.1995bnone" class="reference">(Watchtower 1995b)</span> Jehovah’s Witnesses still believe that Armageddon is imminent. That same article continued, “Does our more precise viewpoint on ‘this generation’ mean that Armageddon is further away than we had thought? Not at all! Though we at no time have known the ‘day and hour,’ Jehovah God has always known it, and he does not change. (Malachi 3:6) … The need to keep awake is more critical than it has ever been. Jehovah has revealed to us ‘the things that must shortly take place,’ and we should respond with an absorbing sense of urgency.”</p> <p>At the same time, the Watch Tower Society changed part of the wording of the stated purpose of the <em>Awake!</em> magazine from “the Creator’s promise of a peaceful and secure new world before the generation that saw the events of 1914 passes away” to “the Creator’s promise of a peaceful and secure new world that is about to replace the present, wicked lawless system of things.”</p> <p>The Witnesses’ viewpoint of the “end of the world” differs from other apocalyptic religions. They do not believe that the physical earth will be destroyed, but rather that both the wicked and unbelievers will be eternally destroyed along with all “worldly” institutions (governments, non-Witness religions, etc.) It is their belief that the earth will be restored to an Eden-like paradise with Jehovah as sovereign and Jesus Christ as King designate.</p> <p><a name="9"> </a></p> <h2>Jehovah’s Witnesses and their families</h2> <p>Being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and having other family members who are not can create strained relationships. When holidays come around (e.g. Christmas, Easter, Birthdays), some Witnesses may feel attendance or participation in holiday parties or gatherings violates their conscience, whether or not other, non-Witness family members choose to attend. It is because of this that many non-Witness family members of Jehovah’s Witnesses feel they are being shunned or that their Witness family members are ‘not allowed’ to be around them at all. This is, for the most part untrue, even though some Witnesses have cut off ties with ‘non-believing’ family members. Association with family members who are not Witnesses is not discouraged to the same extent as with non-relatives, as Witnesses believe they still have responsibilities to their respective families.</p> <p>In families where all are Jehovah’s Witnesses, shunning of a disfellowshipped family member sometimes occurs. The September 15, 1981 <em>Watchtower</em> explains how disfellowshipping impacts family relationships. “The fact is that when a Christian gives himself over to sin and has to be disfellowshipped, he forfeits much: his approved standing with God;….sweet fellowship with the brothers, including much of the association he had with Christian relatives.” (page 31) Those who voluntarily disassociate or resign from Jehovah’s Witnesses similarly forfeit much of the association they have with their Witness relatives. If a relative who is disfellowshipped lives in the same household with Jehovah’s Witnesses, this means the Witness family members will minimize spiritual contact. Day to day activities may be affected, including eating meals at the same table. The August 2002 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry</em>, page 3 explains: “Thus, it would be left to members of the family to decide on the extent to which the disfellowshipped family member would be included when eating or engaging in other household activities. And yet, they would not want to give brothers with whom they associate the impression that everything is the same as it was before the disfellowshipping occurred.”</p> <p>Regarding contact with a disfellowshipped relative living outside the home, a 1988 <em>Watchtower</em> counseled: “It might be possible to have almost no contact at all with the relative. Even if there were some family matters requiring contact, this certainly would be kept to a minimum.” (April 15, 1988, p. 28) “Hence, we also avoid social fellowship with an expelled person. This would rule out joining him in a picnic, party, or trip to the shops or theater or sitting down to a meal with him either in the home or at a restaurant.” (<em>Our Kingdom Ministry,</em> August 2002, page 4.)</p> <p>Witnesses feel that disfellowshipping and shunning can have the beneficial effect of restoring an errant former member to the religion. Critics feel that this policy holds some people captive who might otherwise leave the religion but are afraid of facing shunning from their Witness relatives. The psychological impact of shunning disfellowshipped or disassociated relatives can be extremely painful for both members and ex-members.</p> <div class="fixed"></div> </div> <div class="under"> <span class="categories">Categories: </span> <span><a href="http://www.watchtowerinformationservice.org/category/doctrine-changes/" title="View all posts in Doctrine &amp; Changes" rel="category tag">Doctrine &amp; Changes</a></span> </div> <script type="text/javascript"><!--google_ad_client = "pub-5443112234505638";/* 468x60 WIS under article, created 6/28/09 */google_ad_slot = "2683447191";google_ad_width = 468;google_ad_height = 60;//--></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script> </div> <!-- related posts START --> <!-- related posts END --> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.watchtowerinformationservice.org/wp-content/themes/default/js/comment.js"></script> <div id="comments"> <div id="cmtswitcher"> <a id="commenttab" class="curtab" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="MGJS.switchTab('thecomments,commentnavi', 'thetrackbacks', 'commenttab', 'curtab', 'trackbacktab', 'tab');">Comments (292)</a> <a id="trackbacktab" class="tab" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="MGJS.switchTab('thetrackbacks', 'thecomments,commentnavi', 'trackbacktab', 'curtab', 'commenttab', 'tab');">Trackbacks (0)</a> <span class="addcomment"><a href="#respond">Leave a comment</a></span> <span class="addtrackback"><a href="http://www.watchtowerinformationservice.org/doctrine-changes/jehovahs-witnesses/trackback/">Trackback</a></span> <div class="fixed"></div> </div> <div id="commentlist"> <!-- comments START --> <ol id="thecomments"> <li class="comment regularcomment" id="comment-5280"> <div class="author"> <div class="pic"> <img alt="" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/506cff359d972137f7d61bc20b10b58c?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G" class="avatar avatar-32 photo" height="32" width="32" /> </div> <div class="name"> <span id="commentauthor-5280"> Markus </span> </div> </div> <div class="info"> <div class="date"> August 23rd, 2006 at 17:37 | <a href="#comment-5280">#1</a> </div> <div class="act"> <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="MGJS_CMT.reply('commentauthor-5280', 'comment-5280', 'comment');">Reply</a> | <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="MGJS_CMT.quote('commentauthor-5280', 'comment-5280', 'commentbody-5280', 'comment');">Quote</a> </div> <div class="fixed"></div> <div class="content"> <div id="commentbody-5280"> <p>Jonathan,<br />I’ve lost track of my comment no.33553, not sure which sub-site of this site I placed it.

Can you as well honestly believe that you will somehow persuade some of us who have been in the so-called “truth” for many years and/or have read Franz’s books or maybe even personally know JW’s like Raymond Franz? I even met a JW who actually was so cocky, they put down Franz like he was nothing compared to his years of service &amp; status, until I had him read Franz’s bio. That’s when he finally realized how naive &amp; moronic he sounded to everyone else, you could see it on his face.<br />No offense to you, however I don’t get easily impressed by JW’s with their limited knowledge and acumen, even in biblical matters, attempting to proselytize especially without the use of facts. Here is what is irrefutable, the Watchtower Society (most JW’s unknowingly regard as their mediator &amp; God), is nothing more than a false prophet. Using your own literature dictates that very concept better than any outside influences or writings.<br />My suggestion? Well despite most JW’s performing the typical JW “out of here” maneuver which is akin to an ostrich sticking it’s head in the sand, you could save yourself many wasted years of life, approaching other ideals and facts with an open mind, realizing that your religion may not indeed know everything.<br />Most if not all cults have a bad habit of quickly &amp; conveniently shelving people, ideas or concepts as Satanic, or whatever, as it is easier to take that approach than to think. The last thing the “almighty” Watchtower wants anyone to do is think. God forbid anyone under their influence was to start asking questions they can’t answer, actually the same reaction is seen when you ask tough questions of JW’s….you see either the “out of here” maneuver or they call you crazy. That’s what makes them rather amusing to me, it’s quite ironic to profess how much you know about everything, the bible, etc, however when the tough questions come (and surely you know what these are by now) the attitude changes. Why? Simply because your propaganda agent known as the Watchtower Society hasn’t answered these questions either. If they don’t regularly instill (brainwash) their rank &amp; file with the use of repitition and fear, they won’t know what to say.<br />It’s your life not the Watchtower’s, think about the bigger picture, not the small shallow world pulled over your eyes.</p> <p>Thank you &amp; God bless.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="fixed"></div> </li> <li class="comment regularcomment" id="comment-5278"> <div class="author"> <div class="pic"> <img alt="" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7b185ed542f62626327b257ec97ab36c?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G" class="avatar avatar-32 photo" height="32" width="32" /> </div> <div class="name"> <span id="commentauthor-5278"> Jonathan </span> </div> </div> <div class="info"> <div class="date"> August 23rd, 2006 at 10:28 | <a href="#comment-5278">#3</a> </div> <div class="act"> <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="MGJS_CMT.reply('commentauthor-5278', 'comment-5278', 'comment');">Reply</a> | <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="MGJS_CMT.quote('commentauthor-5278', 'comment-5278', 'commentbody-5278', 'comment');">Quote</a> </div> <div class="fixed"></div> <div class="content"> <div id="commentbody-5278"> <p>I have given a lot of thought to the words I’ve written before.

What they were given, they preached and taught. They wrote in letters to the churches recorded in your New Testament. If you cannot find anything in those letters that commands anyone to do anything you are being taught what is outside the commands of the Holy Spirit. Study for yourself John 14:26 and John 16:12-13. Any new light that is shown already shines in the apostles writings.<br />Study for yourself. I cannot find any command that tells me that I cannot celebrate a birthday or any other holiday. You are being controlled by a group of people who have no authority outside of what the apostles taught. That is fact. Where did they teach that you should be called Jehovah’s Witnesses? What you are distributing door to door is not what the apostles distributed.

Nowhere does the bible mention the early Christians carrying Hebrew scrolls when doing the preaching work.<br />In Mathew chapter 10 and Luke chapter 10 Jesus gives his disciples instructions as to how to carry out the preaching. NO literature was mentioned, as a JW I always wondered why in the bible itself there is no mention of ‘writings’ playing any role in the spreading of the good news. NO prophecy indicated that Christians must use written messages to fulfil the work.<br />The WTS forces the idea of “distributing WT literature” and make the WT literature essential in Gods purpose for mankind by picturing a “prophetic drama” of Abraham and explaining the gifts for Isaacs’s future wife carried by the camels foreshadow the WT publications. Or in the “Revelation Grand Climax!” book the WTS likens the’ TAILS of the locusts from the Abyss’ (Rev. 9:10) to the books, brochures and tracts of the Watchtower Society (page 146).</p> <p>The WTS uses the JW’s to distribute its many publications by making the bible say what it does not. The WTS is a big business publishing company. JW are made to believe they are following the early Christian pattern, but really they are misused to strictly follow the WT program and are controlled by the mandatory filling out of the “field service report”.</p> <p>Tony</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="fixed"></div> </li> <li class="comment admincomment" id="comment-5242"> <div class="author"> <div class="pic"> <img alt="" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?d=identicon&amp;s=32" class="avatar avatar-32 photo avatar-default" height="32" width="32" /> </div> <div class="name"> <span id="commentauthor-5242"> Anonymous </span> </div> </div> <div class="info"> <div class="date"> July 11th, 2006 at 02:13 | <a href="#comment-5242">#34</a> </div> <div class="act"> <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="MGJS_CMT.reply('commentauthor-5242', 'comment-5242', 'comment');">Reply</a> | <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="MGJS_CMT.quote('commentauthor-5242', 'comment-5242', 'commentbody-5242', 'comment');">Quote</a> </div> <div class="fixed"></div> <div class="content"> <div id="commentbody-5242"> <p>Going from door to door telling people that if they don’t become baptized witnesses they will not survive Armageddon is now considered good news????</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="fixed"></div> </li> <li class="comment admincomment" id="comment-5243"> <div class="author"> <div class="pic"> <img alt="" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?d=identicon&amp;s=32" class="avatar avatar-32 photo avatar-default" height="32" width="32" /> </div> <div class="name"> <span id="commentauthor-5243"> Anonymous </span> </div> </div> <div class="info"> <div class="date"> July 10th, 2006 at 22:20 | <a href="#comment-5243">#35</a> </div> <div class="act"> <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="MGJS_CMT.reply('commentauthor-5243', 'comment-5243', 'comment');">Reply</a> | <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="MGJS_CMT.quote('commentauthor-5243', 'comment-5243', 'commentbody-5243', 'comment');">Quote</a> </div> <div class="fixed"></div> <div class="content"> <div id="commentbody-5243"> <p>we are goin door to door to preach the good news like jesus did in is time and we are juste doin what he did</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="fixed"></div> </li> <li class="comment regularcomment" id="comment-5241"> <div class="author"> <div class="pic"> <img alt="" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f3f3a91d1b5c8a7fb1f068dcd6a6a92c?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G" class="avatar avatar-32 photo" height="32" width="32" /> </div> <div class="name"> <span id="commentauthor-5241"> Colette </span> </div> </div> <div class="info"> <div class="date"> July 2nd, 2006 at 05:09 | <a href="#comment-5241">#36</a> </div> <div class="act"> <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="MGJS_CMT.reply('commentauthor-5241', 'comment-5241', 'comment');">Reply</a> | <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="MGJS_CMT.quote('commentauthor-5241', 'comment-5241', 'commentbody-5241', 'comment');">Quote</a> </div> <div class="fixed"></div> <div class="content"> <div id="commentbody-5241"> <p>Blueman,</p> <p>If you indeed look in the NWT you will find some very interesting information on the Trinity in Genesis 18 and 19.

Before that event, some family farmers joined activists at a rally to &quot;to protest the collusion between industrial meat production and our political system.&quot; <p>It's time for a new Bleeding Heartland thread about lean finely textured beef, known to detractors as &quot;pink slime.&quot; A dozen links to news and commentary about this controversy are after the jump.</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="theFlip"> <a href="/userDiary.do?personId=9">desmoinesdem</a> :: <a href="/showDiary.do?diaryId=5438">Lean finely textured beef/&quot;pink slime&quot; linkfest</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td>First, I recommend reading the timeline of events in the life of Beef Products Inc and &quot;pink slime,&quot; which <a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2012/04/bpi-and-pink-slime-a-timeline/">James Andrews compiled for Food Safety News.</a> <p>Governor Branstad has <a href="http://www.bleedingheartland.com/diary/5418/branstad-seeks-congressional-investigation-of-beef-controversy">been on the warpath</a> about what he calls the &quot;smear campaign&quot; against lean finely textured beef, and he <a href="http://www.radioiowa.com/2012/04/11/iowa-state-university-rally-focuses-on-finely-textured-beef">beat that drum again yesterday</a>.</p><p></p> <blockquote> &quot;It's your future that is threatened if campaigns of distortion and smear are successful against safe, wholesome food products,&quot; Branstad said. &nbsp;[...] <p>&quot;We need your help to combat this information and smears and replace it with accurate, scientific information that consumers can rely on,&quot; Branstad told the I.S.U. students. Outside the lecture hall, the animal science students grilled hamburgers containing the beef product.</p> </blockquote><p>The groups that helped organize the competing rally, including Food Democracy Now!, Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, Occupy Ames, and Occupy ISU, see the issue very differently. From a <a href="http://fooddemocracynow.org/blog/2012/apr/9/pink_slime_versus_LFTB/#">press release announcing the protest of</a> &quot;collusion between industrial meat production and our political system&quot;: </p><p></p> <blockquote> The rally organized by family farmers and advocacy organizations was put together in an effort to correct the misleading propaganda being put forward by the meat industry and politicians. <p>The recent controversy surrounding ground beef has brought to the public's attention that an estimated 70 percent of ground beef in the U.S. contains an inferior grade beef parts mixture known as pink slime, which the industry calls &quot;lean, finely textured beef&quot;. While the issue has been around for several years, the controversy reached a boiling point when the USDA announced that it planned to order more than 7 million pounds for the National School Lunch Program, which according to federal regulations allows ground beef to contain up to 15 percent of the substance by weight. &nbsp; </p> <p>The recent controversy has once again laid bare the continued problems that industrial agriculture has in hiding their worst practices from the American public and brought to light the negative consequence that industrial meat production has on family farmers and consumer confidence. &nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;Transparency, knowledge and choice - that is what consumers need in their spending decisions,&quot; said Chris Petersen, a farmer from Clear Lake, Iowa and president of Iowa Farmers Union. &quot;The facts are now coming in and once again people are questioning our food system blessed by the FDA and USDA and a lot of politicians influenced by processors, industrial agriculture, lobbyists and campaign contributions.&quot; </p> <p>Petersen's comment about transparency in food choice and undue political influence is especially important considering the revelation that Eldon and Regina Roth, the owners of Beef Products Inc., the world's largest producer of pink slime, have contributed an estimated $800,000 to local, state and federal elected officials, including more than $150,000 to Governor Branstad.</p> <p>With the recent loss of livestock reforms in Washington DC, known as GIPSA, which were required market protections won during the 2007 Farm Bill and were gutted last winter under meat industry pressure, farmers and ranchers are outraged over the continued political influence of the meat industry, which has driven more than 80,000 beef cattle producers out of business in the past decade with little response from Congress or USDA officials.</p> <p>&quot;Family farmers and ranchers are being used again by giant agribusiness and their pet policies to gain the public's support for one of their most unethical practices that actually cuts the demand for beef cattle,&quot; said George Naylor, a farmer near Churdan, Iowa and the past president of the National Family Farm Coalition. &quot;Farmers, ranchers, and the public should not want 'cheap' food, but food of good quality that's affordable,&quot; Naylor continued.</p> <p>Farmers and ranchers are so outraged over the obvious political favors and deliberate PR spin being waged by the meat industry and political supporters that cattle producer and independent meat processor Mike Callicrate travelled from as far as Colorado to make sure that America heard the message loud and clear. </p> <p>&quot;The use of pink slime is a grave betrayal of trust to our beef eating customers. Selling adulterated, otherwise inedible tissue, to uninformed people is wrong. These irresponsible practices by USDA and our short-sighted, greed driven meat industry are ruinous to our reputation, our financial future and America's food system,&quot; said Callicrate. </p> </blockquote><p>Food Democracy Now! sent out an e-mail blast on April 10 challenging the safety of &quot;pink slime.&quot; Excerpt:</p><p></p> <blockquote> The sad truth is, despite what a number of politicians and the Industrial Meat propagandists would have you believe, before Beef Products Inc. (BPI) invented Pink Slime in the 1990s, this meat by-product would have been used for dog food. [3] Sadly, now it's ending up in our hamburgers and our children's school lunches. <p>What do USDA scientists say about Pink Slime?</p> <p>Gerald Zirnstein, a retired USDA microbiologist who worked at the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service, first coined the phrase &quot;pink slime&quot; in 2002 after touring a BPI plant and has recently told the media, &quot;I have a 2-year-old son, and you better believe I don't want him eating pink slime when he starts going to school.&quot; [4]</p> <p>According to The Daily, retired USDA microbiologist Carl Custer, a 35-year veteran of the Food Safety Inspection Service said, &quot;the idea of mixing in BPI's Lean Beef Trimmings into more nutritious, pure ground beef was itself problematic.&quot; He also told The Daily, &quot;My main objection was that it was not meat&quot;. In addition, a study conducted by Zirstein and Custer classified the trimmings as a &quot;high risk product.&quot;5</p> <p>Why then did three governors recently rush to the Midwest to defend Pink Slime and help promote a food adulteration practice that should never have been allowed in our food supply? Perhaps it is because the owners of Beef Products Inc. have donated nearly $800,000 to political candidates in the past 10 years, including more than $150,000 to Governor Terry Branstad of Iowa, where BPI operates a plant in Waterloo.</p> <p>Even worse, Secretary Vilsack and a top USDA food safety official joined this misguided effort to defend Pink Slime.[6][7]</p> <p>Click here to tell Secretary Vilsack &quot;No Pink Slime in Our Children's School Lunches - not now, not ever!&quot;</p> <p><a href="http://action.fooddemocracynow.org/go/570?akid=511.39608.U_oDE-&amp;t=12">http://action.fooddemocracynow...</a></p> <p>Pink Slime and The New York Times expos&eacute;</p> <p>The process of creating &quot;lean, finely textured beef&quot; aka Pink Slime allows meat processors to take leftover beef scraps, connective tissue, ligaments and other inedible beef parts, spin them in a centrifuge, heating the &quot;parts&quot; until they liquefy and treating the resulting substance with a blast of ammonia. While the use of ammonium hydroxide is used to kill deadly diseases such as E. coli and salmonella, Beef Products Inc. has said that its product is absolutely safe. The original expos&eacute; of Pink Slime in a 2009 New York Times article proves otherwise.8</p> <p>According to the original 2009 Pulitzer Prize winning New York Times investigative report, &quot;Government and industry records obtained by The New York Times show that in testing for the school lunch program, E. coli and salmonella pathogens have been found dozens of times in Beef Products meat, challenging claims by the company and the U.S.D.A. about the effectiveness of the treatment&quot;. As a result of the New York Times investigation and numerous recalls of meat containing BPI's pink slime, the USDA revoked 'Beef Products' exemption from routine testing and conducting a review of the company's operations and research.&quot;</p> <p>Despite the propaganda that BPI and Industrial Meat's PR spin team keep repeating, BPI and their &quot;barely meat&quot; by-products have been found in violation of basic food safety standards and have had higher positive test counts for foodborne disease multiple times.</p> </blockquote><p>Branstad has emphasized the economic importance of lean finely textured beef production to food workers and cattle producers. Others counter that small cattle producers have been hurt by widespread use of the product. At the <a href="http://www.radioiowa.com/2012/04/11/iowa-state-university-rally-focuses-on-finely-textured-beef">competing rally</a>, some farmers told Radio Iowa that lean finely textured beef &quot;has eliminated the need for more than a million cows mostly from independent farms since the 1990s.&quot;</p><p>Representative Steve King <a href="http://www.bleedingheartland.com/diary/5409/iowa-politicians-mobilize-to-defend-pink-slime">has been among the vocal defenders</a> of lean finely textured beef. He took up <a href="http://www.bleedingheartland.com/diary/5418/branstad-seeks-congressional-investigation-of-beef-controversy">Branstad's call</a> for a <a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2012/04/iowa-leaders-seek-congressional-hearing-on-lftb-firestorm/">Congressional investigation</a> into critics of the product.</p><p></p> <blockquote> King has asked Frank Lucas (R-OK), chairman of the House Agriculture Committee to host a hearing that would bring in witnesses to testify on the media firestorm and consumer backlash over the product, which has led to three plant suspensions and sidelined 650 workers in Texas, Kansas, and Iowa -- including some 200 workers in King's district. <p>&quot;Witnesses would be under oath and they're of course obligated by law to tell the truth, those who have been the ones who have perpetrated this smear campaign against one of the stellar companies in the country,&quot; King recently told an Iowa radio station. &quot;I think they'll have an obligation then to explain themselves why they could not base their allegations on facts and what they've done to damage an industry.&quot;</p> <p>The congressman said he believes the campaign is also an &quot;assault&quot; on meat. &quot;I'd like to look at that further,&quot; he said. &quot;Right now, I'm focused on helping BPI get their brand back and their market share back.&quot;</p> <p>Tamara Hinton, communications director for the ag committee, told Food Safety News that, though they are monitoring the issue &quot;closely,&quot; a hearing has not been scheduled.</p> <p>King said he was not considering legislation or any type of &quot;punishment&quot; to address the issue, but is focused on getting the truth out. &quot;Once we get the truth out, then we might look at what we might provide for solutions.&quot; </p> </blockquote><p>Adam Ozimek examined the potential economic and environmental impact of not using lean finely textured beef in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/04/why-you-should-learn-to-love-pink-slime/255488/#.T381U4gWK6s.twitter">an interesting post called &quot;Why You Should Learn to Love Pink Slime.&quot;</a></p><p></p> <blockquote> In this case the joint products are the various beef cuts of beef and pink slime, and the shared costs include things like the price of raising the cow. In these cases profit maximization means considering the total marginal revenue of each unit, which in this case is each cow. A decrease in the demand for the pink slime will drive down the marginal revenue of a cow, which will lower the profit maximizing number of cows produced. <p>However, that is not the end of the story, because pink slime is also a substitute for other parts of the cow, namely ground beef. Schools that are replacing pink slime seem to be doing so with ground beef rather than, say, vegetables. This means that a lot of the decline in the demand for pink slime will be offset by an increase in demand for normal ground beef, which will mean more cows will be slaughtered.</p> <p>So will the number of cows produced and slaughtered increase or decrease? In the end, the cattle industry reports that this filler saves about 10 to 12 pounds of edible meat from every cow, and this is the equivalent of 1.5 million heads of cattle. Despite the lower revenues from each cow discussed above, the demand shift effect will likely outweigh the lower profit effect so that the net impact will be a significant increase in the number of cattle that will be raised and slaughtered every year.</p> <p>You are probably wondering why we should even care how many cows are produced? After all, if a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about. But in his forthcoming book, An Economist Gets Lunch, Tyler Cowen argues that less cows are a good thing given the polluting methane that they produce (cow farts). So we should worry about the negative environmental externalities that this increased production of cows lead to. In addition, [Marion] Nestle reports that half of weight of the 34 million cattle slaughtered each year goes to human consumption, and some of what doesn't get eaten goes into landfills or gets burned up, which could also create environmental costs.</p> <p>While the environmental impacts of getting rid of pink slime aren't certain, intuitively we should not find it too surprising if it turns out getting less food out of each cow is bad for the environment.</p> </blockquote><p>Just last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved <a href="http://www.radioiowa.com/2012/04/04/bpi-gets-approval-to-label-lean-finely-textured-beef-content/">labeling of the percentage of lean finely textured beef from BPI</a>. Speaking to Radio Iowa,</p><p></p> <blockquote> BPI'S Rich Jochum says while ground beef is a single ingredient product and that LTFB is not required to be listed separately on any label, the company believes the voluntary labeling is an important first step to restore consumer confidence in their ground beef. <p>Jochum says based on the number of taste panel studies conduction using BPI'S lean beef and strong consumer preference for ground beef containing LFTB, the company feels this will allow their customers to provide more options to consumers and pave the way for BPI'S lean beef to re-establish its place in the market.</p> </blockquote><p>But many consumers don't want anything to do with this product. That's why the fast food chain Wendy's <a href="http://siouxcityjournal.com/blogs/eye_on_business/eye-on-business-caught-in-wendy-s-crossfire-pr-firm/article_a614fa49-53d8-52ff-9bea-e8455b754d54.html">has been advertising</a>, &quot;We've never used 'pink slime' and we never will. That's our promise to you. That's Wendy's Way.&quot; That ad got the public relations firm that created it in trouble with BPI, which was another client of the same firm. Dave Dreeszen <a href="http://siouxcityjournal.com/blogs/eye_on_business/eye-on-business-caught-in-wendy-s-crossfire-pr-firm/article_a614fa49-53d8-52ff-9bea-e8455b754d54.html">reported for the Sioux City Journal</a>, &quot;The conflict forced Ketchum to turn over the BPI work to another firm in its Omnicom network.&quot;</p><p>Finally, Mark Bittman <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/the-pink-menace/#more-126062">wrote a good piece about &quot;The Pink Menace</a> for the New York Times opinion page.</p><p></p> <blockquote> A little review: Lean Finely Textured Beef was born about 10 years ago, as an attempt to eliminate E. coli from ground beef. Using fatty beef trimmings, which are especially susceptible to E. coli and salmonella contamination, B.P.I. created a product that could be sprayed with ammonia (yes, that stuff, referred to by B.P.I.'s former quality assurance manager as &quot;Mr. Clean,&quot; in this dramatic piece by Michele Simon) to kill the bacteria. It was then mixed with &quot;normal&quot; ground beef.

Recently, however, evolutionary game theory hasbecome of increased interest to economists, sociologists, andanthropologists--and social scientists in general--as well asphilosophers. The interest among social scientists in a theory withexplicit biological roots derives from three facts. First, the‘evolution’ treated by evolutionary game theory need not bebiological evolution. ‘Evolution’ may, in this context,often be understood as <em>cultural</em> evolution, where this refersto changes in beliefs and norms over time. Second, the rationalityassumptions underlying evolutionary game theory are, in many cases,more appropriate for the modelling of social systems than thoseassumptions underlying the traditional theory of games. Third,evolutionary game theory, as an explicitly dynamic theory, provides animportant element missing from the traditional theory. In the prefaceto <em>Evolution and the Theory of Games</em>, Maynard Smith notes that“[p]aradoxically, it has turned out that game theory is more readilyapplied to biology than to the field of economic behaviour for which itwas originally designed.” It is perhaps doubly paradoxical, then, thatthe subsequent development of <em>evolutionary</em> game theory hasproduced a theory which holds great promise for social scientists, andis as readily applied to the field of economic behaviour as that forwhich it was originally designed. </p> <!--Entry Contents--> <ul> <li><a href="#HisDev">1.

Historical Development</a></h2> <p>Evolutionary game theory was first developed by R. A. Fisher [see<em>The Genetic Theory of Natural Selection</em> (1930)] in his attemptto explain the approximate equality of the sex ratio in mammals. Thepuzzle Fisher faced was this: why is it that the sex ratio isapproximately equal in many species where the majority of males nevermate? In these species, the non-mating males would seem to be excessbaggage carried around by the rest of the population, having no realuse. Fisher realized that if we measure individual fitness in terms ofthe expected number of <em>grandchildren</em>, then individual fitnessdepends on the distribution of males and females in the population.When there is a greater number of females in the population, males havea higher individual fitness; when there are more males in thepopulation, females have a higher individual fitness. Fisher pointedout that, in such a situation, the evolutionary dynamics lead to thesex ratio becoming fixed at equal numbers of males and females. Thefact that individual fitness depends upon the relative frequency ofmales and females in the population introduces a strategic element intoevolutions.</p> <p>Fisher's argument can be understood game theoretically, but he didnot state it in those terms. In 1961, R.&nbsp;C. Lewontin made thefirst explicit application of <a href="../game-theory/">game theory</a>to evolutionary biology in “Evolution and the Theory of Games” (not tobe confused with the Maynard Smith work of the same name). In 1972,Maynard Smith defined the concept of an <em>evolutionarily stablestrategy</em> (hereafter ESS) in the article “Game Theory and theEvolution of Fighting.” However, it was the publication of “The Logicof Animal Conflict,” by Maynard Smith and Price in 1973 that introducedthe concept of an ESS into widespread circulation. In 1982, MaynardSmith's seminal text <em>Evolution and the Theory of Games</em>appeared, followed shortly thereafter by Robert Axelrod's famous work<em>The Evolution of Cooperation</em> in 1984. Since then, there hasbeen a veritable explosion of interest by economists and socialscientists in evolutionary game theory (see the bibliographybelow).</p> <h2><a name="TwoAppEvoGamThe">2. Two Approaches to Evolutionary Game Theory</a></h2> <p>There are two approaches to evolutionary game theory. The firstapproach derives from the work of Maynard Smith and Price and employsthe concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy as the principal toolof analysis. The second approach constructs an explicit model of theprocess by which the frequency of strategies change in the populationand studies properties of the evolutionary dynamics within thatmodel.</p> <p>The first approach can thus be thought of as providing a staticconceptual analysis of evolutionary stability. “Static” because,although definitions of evolutionary stability are given, thedefinitions advanced do not typically refer to the underlying processby which behaviours (or strategies) change in the population. Thesecond approach, in contrast, does not attempt to define a notion ofevolutionary stability: once a model of the population dynamics hasbeen specified, all of the standard stability concepts used in theanalysis of dynamical systems can be brought to bear.</p> <h3><a name="DefEvoSta">2.1 Definitions of evolutionary stability </a></h3> <p>As an example of the first approach, consider the problem of theHawk-Dove game, analyzed by Maynard Smith and Price in “The Logic ofAnimal Conflict.” In this game, two individuals compete for a resourceof a fixed value <em>V</em>. (In biological contexts, the value<em>V</em> of the resource corresponds to an increase in the Darwinianfitness of the individual who obtains the resource; in a culturalcontext, the value <em>V</em> of the resource would need to be given analternate interpretation more appropriate to the specific model athand.) Each individual follows exactly one of two strategies describedbelow:</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"><strong>Hawk</strong></td> <td>Initiate aggressive behaviour, not stopping until injured or untilone's opponent backs down.</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><strong>Dove</strong></td> <td>Retreat immediately if one's opponent initiates aggressivebehaviour.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </blockquote> <p>If we assume that (1) whenever two individuals both initiateaggressive behaviour, conflict eventually results and the twoindividuals are equally likely to be injured, (2) the cost of theconflict reduces individual fitness by some constant value <em>C</em>,(3) when a Hawk meets a Dove, the Dove immediately retreats and theHawk obtains the resource, and (4) when two Doves meet the resource isshared equally between them, the fitness payoffs for the Hawk-Dove gamecan be summarized according to the following matrix:</p> <blockquote> <table cellpadding="2"> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> <td align="center"><strong>Hawk</strong></td> <td align="center"><strong>Dove</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Hawk</strong></td> <td align="center">&frac12;(<em>V</em> - <em>C</em>)</td> <td align="center"><em>V</em></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Dove</strong></td> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center"><em>V</em>/2</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br /> <strong>Figure 1:</strong> The Hawk-Dove Game </blockquote> <p>(The payoffs listed in the matrix are for that of a player<em>using</em> the strategy in the appropriate row, playing againstsomeone using the strategy in the appropriate column. For example, ifyou play the strategy Hawk against an opponent who plays the strategyDove, your payoff is <em>V</em>; if you play the strategy Dove againstan opponent who plays the strategy Hawk, your payoff is 0.)</p> <p>In order for a strategy to be evolutionarily stable, it must havethe property that if almost every member of the population follows it,no mutant (that is, an individual who adopts a novel strategy) cansuccessfully invade. This idea can be given a precise characterizationas follows: Let Δ<em>F</em>(<em>s</em><font size="-1"><sub>1</sub></font>,<em>s</em><font size="-1"><sub>2</sub></font>)denote the change in fitness for an individual followingstrategy <em>s</em><font size="-1"><sub>1</sub></font> against anopponent following strategy<em>s</em><font size="-1"><sub>2</sub></font>, and let<em>F</em>(<em>s</em>) denote the total fitness of an individualfollowing strategy <em>s</em>; furthermore, suppose that eachindividual in the population has an initial fitnessof <em>F</em><font size="-1"><sub>0</sub></font>. If σ is anevolutionarily stable strategy and μ a mutant attempting to invadethe population, then</p> <blockquote> <em>F</em>(σ) = <em>F</em> <sub>0</sub> +(1− <em>p</em>)Δ <em>F</em>(σ,σ)+ <em>p</em>Δ <em>F</em>(σ,μ) <p><em>F</em>(μ) = <em>F</em><sub>0</sub> +(1−<em>p</em>)Δ<em>F</em>(μ,σ)+ <em>p</em>Δ<em>F</em>(μ,μ)</p> </blockquote> <p>where <em>p</em> is the proportion of the population following themutant strategy μ.</p> <p>Since σ is evolutionarily stable, the fitness of an individualfollowing σ must be greater than the fitness of an individualfollowing μ (otherwise the mutant following μ would be able toinvade), and so <em>F</em>(σ) &gt; <em>F</em>(μ). Now,as <em>p</em> is very close to 0, this requires that <em>either</em>that</p> <blockquote> Δ <em>F</em>(σ,σ) &gt; Δ <em>F</em>(μ,σ) </blockquote> <em>or</em> that <blockquote> Δ <em>F</em>(σ,σ) = Δ <em>F</em>(μ,σ) and Δ <em>F</em>(σ,μ) &gt; Δ <em>F</em>(μ,μ) </blockquote>(This is the definition of an ESS that Maynard Smith and Price give.)In other words, what this means is that a strategy σ is an ESSif one of two conditions holds: (1) σ does better playingagainst σ than any mutant does playing against σ, or (2)some mutant does just as well playing against σ as σ, butσ does better playing against the mutant than the mutant does. <p>Given this characterization of an evolutionarily stable strategy,one can readily confirm that, for the Hawk-Dove game, the strategy Doveis not evolutionarily stable because a pure population of Doves can beinvaded by a Hawk mutant. If the value <em>V</em> of the resource isgreater than the cost <em>C</em> of injury (so that it is worth riskinginjury in order to obtain the resource), then the strategy Hawk isevolutionarily stable. In the case where the value of the resource is<em>less</em> than the cost of injury, there is no evolutionarilystable strategy if individuals are restricted to following purestrategies, although there is an evolutionarily stable strategy ifplayers may use mixed strategies.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup></p> <p>In the years following the original work of Maynard Smith and Price,alternate analytic solution concepts have been proposed. Of these,two important ones are the idea of an <i>evolutionarily stable set</i>(see Thomas 1984, 1985a,b), and the idea of a “limit ESS” (see Selten1983, 1988). The former provides a setwise generalization of theconcept of an evolutionarily stable strategy, and the latter extendsthe concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy to the context oftwo-player extensive form games.</p> <h3><a name="SpeDynForPop">2.2 Specifying dynamics for the population</a></h3> <p>As an example of the second approach, consider the well-knownPrisoner's Dilemma. In this game, individuals choose one of twostrategies, typically called “Cooperate” and“Defect.” Here is the general form of the payoff matrixfor the prisoner's dilemma:</p> <blockquote> <table border="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> <td align="center"><strong>Cooperate</strong></td> <td align="center"><strong>Defect</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Cooperate</strong></td> <td align="center">(<em>R,R′</em>)</td> <td align="center">(<em>S,T′</em>)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Defect</strong></td> <td align="center">(<em>T,S′</em>)</td> <td align="center">(<em>P,P′</em>)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br /> <strong>Figure 2:</strong> Payoff Matrix for the Prisoner's Dilemma. <br /> Payoffs listed as (row, column). </blockquote> <p>where <em>T</em> &gt; <em>R</em> &gt; <em>P</em> &gt; <em>S</em> and<em>T</em>′ &gt; <em>R</em>′ &gt; <em>P</em>′ &gt;<em>S</em>′. (This form does not require that the payoffs foreach player be symmetric, only that the proper ordering of the payoffsobtains.) In what follows, it will be assumed that the payoffs for thePrisoner's Dilemma are the same for everyone in the population.</p> <p>How will a population of individuals that repeatedly plays thePrisoner's Dilemma evolve? We cannot answer that question withoutintroducing a few assumptions concerning the nature of the population.First, let us assume that the population is quite large. In this case,we can represent the state of the population by simply keeping track ofwhat proportion follow the strategies Cooperate and Defect. Let<em>p<sub>c</sub></em> and <em>p<sub>d</sub></em> denote theseproportions. Furthermore, let us denote the average fitness ofcooperators and defectors by <em>W<sub>C</sub></em> and<em>W<sub>D</sub></em>, respectively, and let <span style="text-decoration:overline;"><em>W</em></span> denote the averagefitness of the entire population. The values of <em>W<sub>C</sub></em>,<em>W<sub>D</sub></em>, and <span style="text-decoration:overline;"><em>W</em></span> can be expressed in terms of the populationproportions and payoff values as follows:</p> <blockquote> <em>W</em> <sub><em>C</em></sub> = <em>F</em> <sub>0</sub> + <em>p</em> <sub><em>c</em></sub>Δ <em>F</em>( <em>C,C</em>) + <em>p</em> <sub><em>d</em></sub>Δ <em>F</em>( <em>C,D</em>) <br /> <em>W</em> <sub><em>D</em></sub> = <em>F</em> <sub>0</sub> + <em>p</em> <sub><em>c</em></sub>Δ <em>F</em>( <em>D,C</em>) + <em>p</em> <sub><em>d</em></sub>Δ <em>F</em>( <em>D,D</em>) <br /> <span style="text-decoration:overline;"><em>W</em></span> = <em>p</em> <sub><em>c</em></sub> <em>W</em> <sub><em>C</em></sub> + <em>p</em> <sub><em>d</em></sub> <em>W</em> <sub><em>D</em></sub> </blockquote> <p>Second, let us assume that the proportion of the population followingthe strategies Cooperate and Defect in the next generation is relatedto the proportion of the population following the strategies Cooperateand Defect in the current generation according to the rule:</p> <blockquote> <table cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr valign="middle"> <td align="right"><img alt="image" src="img50.jpg" /></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td> <td align="right"><img alt="image" src="img52.jpg" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </blockquote>We can rewrite these expressions in the following form: <blockquote> <table cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr valign="middle"> <td align="right"><img alt="image" src="img60.jpg" /></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td> <td align="right"><img alt="image" src="img62.jpg" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </blockquote>If we assume that the change in the strategy frequency from onegeneration to the next are small, these difference equations may beapproximated by the differential equations: <blockquote> <table cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr valign="middle"> <td align="right"><img alt="image" src="img64.jpg" /></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td> <td align="right"><img alt="image" src="img66.jpg" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </blockquote> <p>These equations were offered by Taylor and Jonker (1978) and Zeeman(1979) to provide continuous dynamics for evolutionary game theory andare known as the <em>replicator dynamics</em>.</p> <p>The replicator dynamics may be used to model a population ofindividuals playing the Prisoner's Dilemma. For the Prisoner's Dilemma,the expected fitness of Cooperating and Defecting are:</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td align="right"><em>W</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></td> <td align="left">= <em>F</em><sub>0</sub> +<em>p</em><sub><em>c</em></sub>Δ<em>F</em>(<em>C</em>,<em>C</em>) +<em>p</em><sub><em>d</em></sub>Δ<em>F</em>(<em>C</em>,<em>D</em>)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td align="left">= <em>F</em><sub>0</sub> +<em>p</em><sub><em>c</em></sub><em>R</em> +<em>p</em><sub><em>d</em></sub><em>S</em></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </blockquote>and <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td align="right"><em>W</em><sub><em>D</em></sub></td> <td align="left">= <em>F</em><sub>0</sub> +<em>p</em><sub><em>c</em></sub>Δ<em>F</em>(<em>D</em>,<em>C</em>) +<em>p</em><sub><em>d</em></sub>Δ<em>F</em>(<em>D</em>,<em>D</em>)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td align="left">= <em>F</em><sub>0</sub> +<em>p</em><sub><em>c</em></sub><em>T</em> +<em>p</em><sub><em>d</em></sub><em>P</em>.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </blockquote>Since <em>T</em> &gt; <em>R</em> and <em>P</em> &gt; <em>S</em>, itfollows that <em>W</em> <sub><em>D</em></sub> &gt; <em>W</em> <sub><em>C</em></sub> and hence <em>W</em> <sub><em>D</em></sub> &gt; <span style="text-decoration:overline;"><em>W</em></span> &gt; <em>W</em> <sub><em>C</em></sub>. This means that <blockquote> <img alt="image" src="WD-WbarOWbar.jpg" /> </blockquote>and <blockquote> <img alt="image" src="WC-WbarOWbar.jpg" /> </blockquote>Since the strategy frequencies for Defect and Cooperate in the nextgeneration are given by <blockquote> <img alt="image" src="ppd.jpg" /> </blockquote>and <blockquote> <img alt="image" src="ppc.jpg" /> </blockquote>respectively, we see that over time the proportion of the populationchoosing the strategy Cooperate eventually becomes extinct. Figure 3illustrates one way of representing the replicator dynamical model ofthe prisoner's dilemma, known as a state-space diagram. <blockquote> <img alt="image" src="img82.gif" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 3:</strong> The Replicator Dynamical Model of thePrisoner's Dilemma </blockquote> <p>We interpret this diagram as follows: the leftmost point representsthe state of the population where everyone defects, the rightmost pointrepresents the state where everyone cooperates, and intermediate pointsrepresent states where some proportion of the population defects andthe remainder cooperates. (One maps states of the population ontopoints in the diagram by mapping the state when <em>N</em>% of thepopulation defects onto the point of the line <em>N</em>% of the way tothe leftmost point.) Arrows on the line represent the evolutionarytrajectory followed by the population over time. The open circle at therightmost point indicates that the state where everybody cooperates isan unstable equilibrium, in the sense that if a small portion of thepopulation deviates from the strategy Cooperate, then the evolutionarydynamics will drive the population away from that equilibrium. Thesolid circle at the leftmost point indicates that the state whereeverybody Defects is a stable equilibrium, in the sense that if a smallportion of the population deviates from the strategy Defect, then theevolutionary dynamics will drive the population back to the originalequilibrium state.</p> <p>At this point, one may see little difference between the twoapproaches to evolutionary game theory. One can confirm that, for thePrisoner's Dilemma, the state where everybody defects is the only ESS.Since this state is the only stable equilibrium under the replicatordynamics, the two notions fit together quite neatly: the only stableequilibrium under the replicator dynamics occurs when everyone in thepopulation follows the only ESS. In general, though, the relationshipbetween ESSs and stable states of the replicator dynamics is morecomplex than this example suggests. Taylor and Jonker (1978), as wellas Zeeman (1979), establish conditions under which one may infer theexistence of a stable state under the replicator dynamics given anevolutionarily stable strategy. Roughly, if only two pure strategiesexist, then given a (possibly mixed) evolutionarily stable strategy,the corresponding state of the population is a stable state under thereplicator dynamics. (If the evolutionarily stable strategy is a mixedstrategy <em>S</em>, the corresponding state of the population is thestate in which the proportion of the population following the firststrategy equals the probability assigned to the first strategy by<em>S</em>, and the remainder follow the second strategy.) However,this can fail to be true if more than two pure strategies exist.</p> <p>The connection between ESSs and stable states under an evolutionarydynamical model is weakened further if we do not model the dynamics bythe replicator dynamics. For example, suppose we use a localinteraction model in which each individual plays the prisoner's dilemmawith his or her neighbors. Nowak and May (1992, 1993), using a spatialmodel in which local interactions occur between individuals occupyingneighboring nodes on a square lattice, show that stable populationstates for the prisoner's dilemma depend upon the specific form of thepayoff matrix.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup></p> <p>When the payoff matrix for the population has the values <em>T</em>= 2.8, <em>R</em> = 1.1, <em>P</em> = 0.1, and <em>S</em> = 0, theevolutionary dynamics of the local interaction model agree with thoseof the replicator dynamics, and lead to a state where each individualfollows the strategy Defect--which is, as noted before, the onlyevolutionarily stable strategy in the prisoner's dilemma. The figurebelow illustrates how rapidly one such population converges to a statewhere everyone defects.</p> <!--pdf include<br/><br/><br/>pdf include--> <blockquote> <table cellpadding="3"> <tbody> <tr> <td align="center"><img alt="image" width="136" align="bottom" border="1" src="img91.gif" /></td> <td align="center"><img alt="image" width="136" align="bottom" border="1" src="img92.gif" /></td> <td align="center"><img alt="image" width="136" align="bottom" border="1" src="img93.gif" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">Generation 1</td> <td align="center">Generation 2</td> <td align="center">Generation 3</td> <td align="center">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center"><img alt="image" width="141" height="141" align="bottom" border="1" src="img94.gif" /></td> <td align="center"><img alt="image" width="141" height="141" align="bottom" border="1" src="img95.gif" /></td> <td align="center"><img alt="image" width="141" height="141" align="bottom" border="0" src="img96.gif" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">Generation 4</td> <td align="center">Generation 5</td> <td align="center">Generation 6</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br /> <strong>Figure 4:</strong> Prisoner's Dilemma: All Defect <br /> <a href="pd-defect.gif">[View a movie of this model]</a> </blockquote> <p>However, when the payoff matrix has values of <em>T</em> = 1.2,<em>R</em> = 1.1, <em>P</em> = 0.1, and <em>S</em> = 0, theevolutionary dynamics carry the population to a stable cycleoscillating between two states.

Why Evolutionary Game Theory?</a></h2>Although evolutionary game theory has provided numerous insights toparticular evolutionary questions, a growing number of socialscientists have become interested in evolutionary game theory in hopesthat it will provide tools for addressing a number of deficiencies inthe traditional theory of games, three of which are discussed below. <h3><a name="EquSelPro">3.1 The equilibrium selection problem</a></h3>The concept of a Nash equilibrium (see the entry on <a href="../game-theory/">game theory</a>) has been the most used solutionconcept in game theory since its introduction by John Nash in 1950. Aselection of strategies by a group of agents is said to be in a Nashequilibrium if each agent's strategy is a best-response to thestrategies chosen by the other players. By best-response, we mean thatno individual can improve her payoff by switching strategies unless atleast one other individual switches strategies as well. This need notmean that the payoffs to each individual are optimal in a Nashequilibrium: indeed, one of the disturbing facts of the prisoner'sdilemma is that the only Nash equilbrium of the game--when both agentsdefect--is suboptimal. <sup>[<a href="notes.html#4" name="note-4">4</a>]</sup> <p>Yet a difficulty arises with the use of Nash equilibrium as asolution concept for games: if we restrict players to using purestrategies, not every game has a Nash equilbrium. The game “MatchingPennies” illustrates this problem.</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left"></td> <td align="center"><strong>Heads</strong></td> <td align="center"><strong>Tails</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left"><strong>Heads</strong></td> <td align="center">(0,1)</td> <td align="center">(1,0)</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left"><strong>Tails</strong></td> <td align="center">(1,0)</td> <td align="center">(0,1)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br /> <strong>Figure 7:</strong> Payoff matrix for the game of MatchingPennies <br /> (Row wins if the two coins do not match, whereas Column wins if thetwo coins match). </blockquote> <p>While it is true that every noncooperative game in which players mayuse mixed strategies has a Nash equilibrium, some have questioned thesignificance of this for real agents. If it seems appropriate torequire rational agents to adopt only pure strategies (perhaps becausethe cost of implementing a mixed strategy runs too high), then the gametheorist must admit that certain games lack solutions.</p> <p>A more significant problem with invoking the Nash equilibrium as theappropriate solution concept arises because games exist which havemultiple Nash equilibria (see the section on <a href="../game-theory/index.html#solution">Solution Concepts and Equilibria</a>, in the entry on game theory). When there are severaldifferent Nash equilibria, how is a rational agent to decide which ofthe several equilibria is the “right one” to settle upon?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#5" name="note-5">5</a>]</sup> Attempts to resolve this problem have produced a number of possiblerefinements to the concept of a Nash equilibrium, each refinementhaving some intuitive purchase. Unfortunately, so many refinements ofthe notion of a Nash equilibrium have been developed that, in manygames which have multiple Nash equilibria, each equilibrium could bejustified by some refinement present in the literature. The problemhas thus shifted from choosing among multiple Nash equilibria tochoosing among the various refinements. Some (see Samuelson (1997),<em>Evolutionary Games and Equilibrium Selection</em>) hope thatfurther development of evolutionary game theory can be of service inaddressing this issue.</p> <h3><a name="ProHypAge">3.2 The problem of hyperrational agents</a></h3>The traditional theory of games imposes a very high rationalityrequirement upon agents. This requirement originates in the developmentof the theory of utility which provides game theory's underpinnings(see Luce (1950) for an introduction). For example, in order to be ableto assign a cardinal utility function to individual agents, onetypically assumes that each agent has a well-defined, consistent set ofpreferences over the set of “lotteries” over the outcomes which mayresult from individual choice. Since the number of different lotteriesover outcomes is uncountably infinite, this requires each agent to havea well-defined, consistent set of uncountably infinitely manypreferences. <p>Numerous results from experimental economics have shown that thesestrong rationality assumptions do not describe the behavior of realhuman subjects. Humans are rarely (if ever) the hyperrational agentsdescribed by traditional game theory. For example, it is not uncommonfor people, in experimental situations, to indicate that they prefer<em>A</em> to <em>B</em>, <em>B</em> to <em>C</em>, and <em>C</em> to<em>A</em>. These “failures of the transitivity of preference” wouldnot occur if people had a well-defined consistent set of preferences.Furthermore, experiments with a class of games known as a “beautypageant” show, quite dramatically, the failure of common knowledgeassumptions typically invoked to solve games.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#6" name="note-6">6</a>]</sup> Since evolutionary gametheory successfully explains the predominance of certain behaviors ofinsects and animals, where strong rationality assumptions clearly fail,this suggests that rationality is not as central to game theoreticanalyses as previously thought. The hope, then, is that evolutionarygame theory may meet with greater success in describing and predictingthe choices of human subjects, since it is better equipped to handlethe appropriate weaker rationality assumptions.</p> <h3><a name="LacDynTheTraTheGam">3.3 The lack of a dynamical theory in the traditional theory of games</a></h3> <p>At the end of the first chapter of <em>Theory of Games and EconomicBehavior</em>, von Neumann and Morgenstern write: </p> <blockquote> We repeat most emphatically that our theory is thoroughlystatic. A dynamic theory would unquestionably be more complete andtherefore preferable. But there is ample evidence from other branchesof science that it is futile to try to build one as long as the staticside is not thoroughly understood. (Von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1953,p. 44) </blockquote> <p>The theory of evolution is a dynamical theory, and the second approachto evolutionary game theory sketched above explicitly models thedynamics present in interactions among individuals in the population.Since the traditional theory of games lacks an explicit treatment ofthe dynamics of rational deliberation, evolutionary game theory can beseen, in part, as filling an important lacuna of traditional gametheory. </p> <p>One may seek to capture some of the dynamics of the decision-makingprocess in traditional game theory by modeling the game in itsextensive form, rather than its normal form. However, for most games ofreasonable complexity (and hence interest), the extensive form of thegame quickly becomes unmanageable. Moreover, even in the extensive formof a game, traditional game theory represents an individual's strategyas a specification of what choice that individual would make at eachinformation set in the game. A selection of strategy, then, correspondsto a selection, prior to game play, of what that individual will do atany possible stage of the game. This representation of strategyselection clearly presupposes hyperrational players and fails torepresent the process by which one player observes his opponent'sbehavior, learns from these observations, and makes the best move inresponse to what he has learned (as one might expect, for there is noneed to model learning in hyperrational individuals). The inability tomodel the dynamical element of game play in traditional game theory,and the extent to which evolutionary game theory naturally incorporatesdynamical considerations, reveals an important virtue of evolutionarygame theory.</p> <h2><a name="AppEvoGamThe">4. Applications of Evolutionary Game Theory</a></h2> <p>Evolutionary game theory has been used to explain a number ofaspects of human behavior. A small sampling of topics which have beenanalysed from the evolutionary perspective include:<b>altruism</b> (Fletcher and Zwick, 2007; Gintis <em>et al</em>.,2003; Sanchez and Cuesta, 2005; Trivers, 1971), <b>behavior in publicgoods game</b> (Clemens and Riechmann, 2006; Hauert, 2006;Hauert <em>et al</em>., 2002, 2006; Huberman and Glance,1995), <b>empathy</b> (Page and Nowak, 2002; Fishman, 2006), <b>humanculture</b> (Enquist and Ghirlanda, 2007; Enquist <em>et al</em>.,2008), <b>moral behaviour</b> (Alexander, 2007; Boehm, 1982; Harms andSkyrms, 2008; Skyrms 1996, 2004), <b>private property</b> (Gintis,2007), <b>signaling systems and other proto-linguistic behaviour</b>(Barrett, 2007; Hausken and Hirshleirfer, 2008; Hurd, 1995; Jager,2008; Nowak <em>et al</em>., 1999; Pawlowitsch, 2007, 2008; Skyrms,forthcoming; Zollman, 2005), <b>social learning</b> (Kameda andNakanishi, 2003; Nakahashi, 2007; Rogers, 1988; Wakano and Aoki, 2006;Wakano <em>et al</em>., 2004), and <b>social norms</b> (Axelrod, 1986;Bicchieri, 2006; Binmore and Samuelson, 1994; Chalub <em>et al</em>.,2006; Kendal <em>et al</em>., 2006; Ostrum, 2000). </p> <p>The following subsections provide a brief illustration of the useof evolutionary game theoretic models to explain two areas of humanbehavior. The first concerns the tendency of people to share equallyin perfectly symmetric situations. The second shows how populationsof pre-linguistic individuals may coordinate on the use of a simplesignaling system even though they lack the ability to communicate.These two models have been pointed to as preliminary explanations ofour sense of fairness and language, respectively. They were selectedfor inclusion here primarily because of the relative simplicity of themodel and apparent success at explaining the phenomenon inquestion.</p> <h3><a name="SenFai">4.1 A sense of fairness</a></h3> <p>One natural game to use for investigating the evolution of fairnessis <em>divide-the-cake</em> (this is the simplest version of the Nashbargaining game). In chapter 1 of <em>Evolution of the SocialContract</em>, Skyrms presents the problem as follows:</p> <blockquote> Here we start with a very simple problem; we are to divide a chocolatecake between us. Neither of us has any special claim as against theother. Out positions are entirely symmetric. The cake is a windfallfor us, and it is up to us to divide it. But if we cannot agree how toshare it, the cake will spoil and we will get nothing. (Skyrms, 1996,pp. 3–4) </blockquote> <p>More formally, suppose that two individuals are presented with aresource of size <em>C</em> by a third party. A <em>strategy</em> fora player, in this game, consists of an amount of cake that he wouldlike. The set of possible strategies for a player is thus any amountbetween 0 and <em>C</em>. If the sum of strategies for each player isless than or equal to <em>C</em>, each player receives the amount heasked for. However, if the sum of strategies exceeds <em>C</em>, noplayer receives anything. Figure 8 illustrates the feasible set forthis game.</p> <blockquote> <table cellpadding="3"> <tbody> <tr> <td align="center"><img alt="image" width="400" align="bottom" border="1" src="dtd.gif" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br /> <strong>Figure 8:</strong> The feasible set for the game ofDivide-the-Cake. In this figure, the cake is of size <em>C</em>=10but all strategies between 0 and 10 inclusive are permitted for eitherplayer (including fractional demands). </blockquote> <p>We have a clear intuition that the “obvious” strategy for eachplayer to select is <em>C/2</em>; the philosophical problem lies inexplaining <em>why</em> agents would choose that strategy rather thansome other one. Even in the perfectly symmetric situation, answeringthis question is more difficult than it first appears. To see this,first notice that there are an infinite number of Nash equilibria forthis game. If player 1 asks for <em>p</em> of the cake, where <em>0≤ p ≤ C</em>, and player 2 asks for <em>C − p</em>, thenthis strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium for any valueof <em>p</em> ∈ [0,C]. (Each player's strategy is a bestresponse given what the other has chosen, in the sense that neitherplayer can increase her payoff by changing her strategy.) However,the equal split is only one of infinitely many Nash equilibria.</p> <p>One might propose that both players should choose that strategywhich maximizes their expected payoff on the assumption they areuncertain as to whether they will be assigned the role of Player 1 orPlayer 2. This proposal, Skyrms notes, is essentially that ofHarsanyi (1953). The problem with this is that if players only careabout their expected payoff, and they think that it is equally likelythat they will be assigned the role of Player 1 or Player 2, thenthis, too, fails to select uniquely the equal split. Consider thestrategy profile ⟨<em>p, C − p</em>⟩ which assignsPlayer 1 <em>p</em> slices and Player 2 <em>C − p</em> slices.If a player thinks it is equally likely that he will be assigned therole of Player 1 or Player 2, then his expected utility is&frac12;<em>p</em> + &frac12;(<em>C−p</em>) = <em>C</em>/2, forall values <em>p</em> ∈ [0, <em>C</em>].</p> <p>Now consider the following evolutionary model: suppose we have apopulation of individuals who pair up and repeatedly play the game ofdivide-the-cake, modifying their strategies over time in a way whichis described by the replicator dynamics. For convenience, let usassume that the cake is divided into 10 equally sized slices and thateach player's strategy conforms to one of the following 11 possibletypes: Demand 0 slices, Demand 1 slice, … , Demand 10 slices.For the replicator dynamics, the state of the population isrepresented by a vector⟨<em>p</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>p</em><sub>1</sub>, …,<em>p</em><sub>10</sub>⟩ where each <em>p<sub>i</sub></em>denotes the frequency of the strategy “Demand <em>i</em> slices” inthe population.</p> <p>The replicator dynamics allows us to model how the distribution ofstrategies in the population changes over time, beginning from aparticular initial condition. Figure 9 below shows two evolutionaryoutcomes under the continuous replicator dynamics. Notice thatalthough fair division can evolve, as in Figure 9(a), it is not theonly evolutionary outcome, as Figure 9(b) illustrates.</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td align="center"><img alt="image" width="500" align="bottom" border="1" src="dtd-fig-1.gif" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">(a) The evolution of fair division.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td align="center"><img alt="image" width="500" align="bottom" border="1" src="dtd-fig-2.gif" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">(b) The evolution of an unequal division rule.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br /> <strong>Figure 9:</strong> Two evolutionary outcomes under thecontinuous replicator dynamics for the game of divide-the-cake. Ofthe eleven strategies present, only three are colour-coded so as to beidentifiable in the plot (see the legend). The initial conditions forthe solution shown in (a) was the point ⟨0.0544685, 0.236312,0.0560727, 0.0469244, 0.0562243, 0.0703294, 0.151136, 0.162231,0.0098273, 0.111366, 0.0451093⟩, and the initial conditions forthe solution shown in (b) was the point ⟨0.410376, 0.107375,0.0253916, 0.116684, 0.0813494, 0.00573677, 0.0277155, 0.0112791,0.0163166, 0.191699, 0.00607705⟩. </blockquote> <p>Recall that the task at hand was to explain why we think the“obvious” strategy choice in a perfectly symmetric resource allocationproblem is for both players to ask for half of the resource. What theabove shows is that, in a population of boundedly rational agents whomodify their behaviours in a manner described by the replicatordynamics, fair division is one, although not the only, evolutionaryoutcome. The tendency of fair division to emerge, assuming that anyinitial condition is equally likely, can be measured by determiningthe size of the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BasinofAttraction.html" target="other">basin of attraction</a> of the state where everyone in the population uses the strategy Demand 5 slices. Skyrms (1996) measures the size of thebasin of attraction of fair divisionusing <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MonteCarloMethod.html" target="other">Monte Carlo methods</a>, finding that fair division evolves roughly 62% of the time.</p> <p>However, it is important to realise that the replicator dynamicsassumes any pairwise interaction between individuals is equallylikely. In reality, quite often interactions between individualsare <em>correlated</em> to some extent. Correlated interaction canoccur as a result of spatial location (as shown above for the case ofthe spatial prisoner's dilemma), the structuring effect of socialrelations, or ingroup/outgroup membership effects, to list a fewcauses.</p> <p>When correlation is introduced, the frequency with which fairdivision emerges changes drastically. Figure 10 illustrates how thebasin of attraction of All Demand 5 changes as the correlationcoefficient ε increases from 0 to 0.2.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#7" name="note-7">7</a>]</sup> Once the amount of correlation present in the interactions reachesε = 0.2, fair division is virtually an evolutionary certainty.Note that this does not depend on there only being three strategiespresent: allowing for some correlation between interactions increasesthe probability of fair division evolving even if the initialconditions contain individuals using any of the eleven possiblestrategies.</p> <blockquote> <table cellpadding="3"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img alt="image" align="bottom" width="275" src="nash-4-5-6-simplex-nobox.gif" /></td> <td><img alt="image" align="bottom" width="275" src="nash-4-5-6-corr-1.gif" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">(a) ε = 0</td> <td align="center">(b) ε = 0.1</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><img alt="image" align="bottom" width="300" src="nash-4-5-6-corr-2.gif" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">(c) ε = 0.2</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br /> <strong>Figure 10:</strong> Three diagrams showing how, as the amountof correlation among interactions increases, fair division is morelikely to evolve. </blockquote> <p>What, then, can we conclude from this model regarding the evolution offair division? It all depends, of course, on how accurately thereplicator dynamics models the primary evolutionary forces (culturalor biological) acting on human populations. Although the replicatordynamics are a “simple” mathematical model, it does suffice formodelling both a type of biological evolution (see Taylor and Jonker,1978) and a type of cultural evolution (see B&ouml;rgers and Sarin,1996; Weibull, 1995). As Skyrms (1996) notes:</p> <blockquote> In a finite population, in a finite time, where there is some randomelement in evolution, some reasonable amount of divisibility of thegood and some correlation, we can say that it is likely that somethingclose to share and share alike should evolve in dividing-the-cakesituations. This is, perhaps, a beginning of an explanation of theorigin of our concept of justice. </blockquote> <p>This claim, of course, has not gone without comment. For aselection of some discussion see, in particular, D'Arms (1996, 2000);D'Arms <em>et al</em>., 1998; Danielson (1998); Bicchieri (1999);Kitcher (1999); Gintis (2000); Harms (2000); Krebs (2000); Alexanderand Skyrms (1999); and Alexander (2000, 2007).</p> <h3><a name="EmeLan">4.2 The emergence of language.</a></h3> <p>In his seminal work <em>Convention</em>, David Lewis developed theidea of sender-receiver games. Such games have been used to explainhow language, and semantic content, can emerge in a community whichoriginally did not possess any language whatsoever.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#8" name="note-8">8</a>]</sup> His original definition is as follows (with portions of extraneouscommentary deleted for concision and points enumerated for clarity andlater reference):</p> <blockquote> A <em>two-sided signaling problem</em> is a situation <em>S</em>involving an agent called the <em>communicator</em> and one or moreother agents called the <em>audience</em>, such that it is true that,and it is common knowledge for the communicator and the audience that: <ol> <li>Exactly one of several alternative states ofaffairs <em>s</em><sub>1</sub>, …, <em>s<sub>m</sub></em>holds. The communicator, but not the audience, is in a good positionto tell which one it is.</li> <li>Each member of the audience can do any one of several alternativeactions <em>r</em><sub>1</sub>, …, <em>r<sub>m</sub></em>called <em>responses</em>. Everyone involved wants the audience'sresponses to depend in a certain way upon the state of affairs thatholds. There is a certain one-to-one function <em>F</em> from{<em>s<sub>i</sub></em>} onto {<em>r<sub>j</sub></em>} such thateveryone prefers that each member of the audiencedo <em>F</em>(<em>s<sub>i</sub></em>) on conditionthat <em>s<sub>i</sub></em> holds, for each <em>s<sub>i</sub></em>.</li> <li>The communicator can do any one of several alternative actionsσ<sub>1</sub>, …, σ<em><sub>n</sub></em>(<em>n</em> ≥ <em>m</em>) called <em>signals</em>. The audience isin a good position to tell which one he does. No one involved has anypreference regarding these actions which is strong enough to outweighhis preference for the dependence <em>F</em> of audience's responsesupon states of affairs. […]</li> <li>A <em>communicator's contingency plan</em> is any possible way inwhich the communicator's signal may depend upon the state of affairsthat he observes to hold. It is a function <em>Fc</em> from{<em>s<sub>i</sub></em>} into {σ<em><sub>k</sub></em>}. […]</li> <li>Similarly, an <em>audience's contingency plan</em> is any possibleway in which the response of a member of the audience may depend uponthe signal he observes the communicator to give. It is a one-to-onefunction <em>Fa</em> from part of {σ<sub><em>k</em></sub>} into{<em>r<sub>j</sub></em>}. […]</li> </ol> <p>Whenever <em>Fc</em> and <em>Fa</em> combine […] to give thepreferred dependence of the audience's response upon the state ofaffairs, we call ⟨<em>Fc</em>, <em>Fa</em>⟩ a <em>signalingsystem</em>. (Lewis, 1969, pp. 130–132) </p> </blockquote> <p>Since the publication of <em>Convention</em>, it is more common torefer to the communicator as the <em>sender</em> and the members ofthe audience as <em>receivers</em>. The basic idea behindsender-receiver games is the following: Nature selects which state ofthe world obtains. The person in the role of Sender observes thisstate of the world (correctly identifying it), and sends a signal tothe person in the role of Receiver. The Receiver, upon receipt ofthis signal, performs a response. If what the Receiver does is thecorrect response, given the state of the world, then both playersreceive a payoff of 1; if the Receiver performed an incorrectresponse, then both players receive a payoff of 0. Notice that, inthis simplified model, no chance of error exists at any stage. TheSender always observes the true state of the world and always sendsthe signal he intended to send. Likewise, the Receiver alwaysreceives the signal sent by the Sender (i.e., the channel is notnoisy), and the Receiver always performs the response he intendedto.</p> <p>Whereas Lewis allowed the “audience” to consist of more than oneperson, it is more common to consider sender-receiver games playedbetween two people, so that there is only a single receiver (or, inLewisian terms, a single member of the audience).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#9" name="note-9">9</a>]</sup> For simplicity, in the following we will consider a two-player,sender-receiver game with two states of the world{<em>S</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>}, two signals{σ<sub>1</sub>, σ<sub>2</sub>}, and two responses{<em>r</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>r</em><sub>2</sub>}. (We shall see laterwhy larger sender-receiver games are increasingly difficult toanalyse.)</p> <p>Notice that, in point (2) of his definition of sender-receivergames, Lewis requires two things: that there be a unique best responseto the state of the world (this is what requiring <em>F</em> to beone-to-one amounts to) and that everyone in the audience agrees thatthis is the case. Since we are considering the case where there isonly a single responder, the second requirement is otiose. For thecase of two states of the world and two responses, there are only twoways of assigning responses to states of the world which satisfyLewis's requirement. These are as follows (where <em>X</em>⇒ <em>Y</em> denotes “in state of the world <em>X</em>, the bestresponse is to do <em>Y</em>”):</p> <blockquote> <ol> <li><em>S</em><sub>1</sub> ⇒ <em>r</em><sub>1</sub>,<em>S</em><sub>2</sub> ⇒ <em>r</em><sub>2</sub>.</li> <li><em>S</em><sub>1</sub> ⇒ <em>r</em><sub>2</sub>,<em>S</em><sub>2</sub> ⇒ <em>r</em><sub>1</sub>.</li> </ol> </blockquote> <p>It makes no real difference for the model which one of these wechoose, so pick the intuitive one: in state of theworld <em>S<sub>i</sub></em>, the best responseis <em>r<sub>i</sub></em> (i.e., function 1).</p> <p>A <em>strategy for the sender</em> (what Lewis called a“communicator's contingency plan”) consists of a function specifyingwhat signal he sends given the state of the world. It is, as Lewisnotes, a function from the set of states of the world <em>into</em>the set of signals. This means that it is possible that a sender maysend the <em>same</em> signal in two different states of theworld. Such a strategy makes no sense, from a rational point of view,because the receiver would not get enough information to be able toidentify the correct response for the state of the world. However, wedo not exclude these strategies from consideration because they arelogically possible strategies.</p> <p>How many sender strategies are there? Because we allow for thepossibility of the same signal to be sent for multiple states of theworld, there are two choices for which signal to send givenstate <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> and two choices for which signal to sendgiven state <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>. This means there are fourpossible sender strategies. These strategies are as follows (where'<em>X</em> → <em>Y</em>' means that when the state of the worldis <em>X</em> the sender will send signal <em>Y</em>):</p> <blockquote> <b>Sender 1: </b> <em>S</em> <sub>1</sub> → σ <sub>1</sub>, <em>S</em> <sub>2</sub> → σ <sub>1</sub>. <br /> <b>Sender 2: </b> <em>S</em> <sub>1</sub> → σ <sub>1</sub>, <em>S</em> <sub>2</sub> → σ <sub>2</sub>. <br /> <b>Sender 3: </b> <em>S</em> <sub>1</sub> → σ <sub>2</sub>, <em>S</em> <sub>2</sub> → σ <sub>1</sub>. <br /> <b>Sender 4: </b> <em>S</em> <sub>1</sub> → σ <sub>2</sub>, <em>S</em> <sub>2</sub> → σ <sub>2</sub>. </blockquote> <p>What is a strategy for a receiver? Here, it proves useful todeviate from Lewis's original definition of the “audience'scontingency plan”. Instead, let us take a receiver's strategy to be afunction from the set of signals into the set of responses. As in thecase of the sender, we allow the receiver to perform the same responsefor more than one signal. By symmetry, this means there are <b>4</b>possible receiver strategies. These receiver strategies are:</p> <blockquote> <b>Receiver 1: </b>σ <sub>1</sub> → <em>r</em> <sub>1</sub>,σ <sub>2</sub> → <em>r</em> <sub>1</sub>. <br /> <b>Receiver 2: </b>σ <sub>1</sub> → <em>r</em> <sub>1</sub>,σ <sub>2</sub> → <em>r</em> <sub>2</sub>. <br /> <b>Receiver 3: </b>σ <sub>1</sub> → <em>r</em> <sub>2</sub>,σ <sub>2</sub> → <em>r</em> <sub>1</sub>. <br /> <b>Receiver 4: </b>σ <sub>1</sub> → <em>r</em> <sub>2</sub>,σ <sub>2</sub> → <em>r</em> <sub>2</sub>. <br /> </blockquote> <p>If the roles of Sender and Receiver are permanently assigned toindividuals — as Lewis envisaged — then there are only two possiblesignaling systems: ⟨Sender 2, Receiver 2⟩ and ⟨Sender3, Receiver 3⟩. All other possible combinations of strategiesresult in the players failing to coordinate. The coordination failureoccurs because the Sender and Receiver only pair the appropriateaction with the state of the world in one instance, as with⟨Sender 1, Receiver 1⟩, or not at all, as with ⟨Sender2, Receiver 3⟩.</p> <p>What if the roles of Sender and Receiver are not permanentlyassigned to individuals? That is, what if nature flips a coin andassigns one player to the role of Sender and the other player to therole of Receiver, and then has them play the game? In this case, aplayer's strategy needs to specify what he will do when assigned therole of Sender, as well as what he will do when assigned the role ofReceiver. Since there are four possible strategies to use as Senderand four possible strategies to use as Receiver, this means that thereare a total of <b>16</b> possible strategies for the sender-receivergame when roles are not permanently assigned to individuals. Here, aplayer's strategy consists of an ordered pair (Sender <em>X</em>,Receiver <em>Y</em>), where <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em> ∈ {1, 2, 3,4}.</p> <p>It makes a difference whether one considers the roles of Sender andReceiver to be permanently assigned or not. If the roles are assignedat random, there are four signaling systems amongst two players<sup>[<a href="notes.html#10" name="note-10">10</a>]</sup>:</p> <ol> <li><b>Player 1: </b> (Sender 2, Receiver 2), <b>Player 2: </b> (Sender 2, Receiver 2)</li> <li><b>Player 1: </b> (Sender 3, Receiver 3), <b>Player 2: </b> (Sender 3, Receiver 3)</li> <li><b>Player 1: </b> (Sender 2, Receiver 3), <b>Player 2: </b> (Sender 3, Receiver 2)</li> <li><b>Player 1: </b> (Sender 3, Receiver 2), <b>Player 2: </b> (Sender 2, Receiver 3)</li> </ol> <p>Signaling systems 3 and 4 are curious. System 3 is a case where, forexample, I speak in French but listen in German, and you speak Germanbut listen in French. (System 4 swaps French and German for both youand me.) Notice that in systems 3 and 4 the players are able tocorrectly coordinate the response with the state of theworld <em>regardless</em> of who gets assigned the role of Sender orReceiver.</p> <p>The problem, of course, with signaling systems 3 and 4 is thatneither Player 1 nor Player 2 would do well when pitted against aclone of himself. They are cases where the signaling system would notwork in a population of players who are pairwise randomly assigned toplay the sender-receiver game. In fact, it is straightforward to showthat the strategies (Sender 2, Receiver 2) and (Sender 3, Receiver 3)are the only evolutionarily stable strategies (see Skyrms 1996,89–90).</p> <p>As a first approach to the dynamics of sender-receiver games, letus restrict attention to the four strategies (Sender 1, Receiver 1),(Sender 2, Receiver 2), (Sender 3, Receiver 3), and (Sender 4,Receiver 4). Figure 11 illustrates the state space under thecontinuous replicator dynamics for the sender-receiver game consistingof two states of the world, two signals, and two responses, whereplayers are restricted to using one of the previous four strategies.One can see that evolution leads the population in almost all cases<sup>[<a href="notes.html#11" name="note-11">11</a>]</sup> to converge to one of the two signaling systems.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#12" name="note-12">12</a>]</sup></p> <blockquote> <table cellpadding="3"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img alt="image" align="bottom" width="275" src="sr-N2-fig01.gif" /></td> <td><img alt="image" align="bottom" width="275" src="sr-N2-fig02.gif" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td><img alt="image" align="bottom" width="300" src="sr-N2-fig03.gif" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br /> <strong>Figure 11:</strong> The evolution of signaling systems. </blockquote> <p>Figure 12 illustrates the outcome of one run of the replicatordynamics (for a single population model) where all sixteen possiblestrategies are represented. We see that eventually the population, forthis particular set of initial conditions, converges to one of thepure Lewisian signalling systems identified above.</p> <blockquote> <table cellpadding="3"> <tbody> <tr> <td align="center"><img alt="image" align="bottom" width="550" src="sender-receiver-1.gif" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br /> <strong>Figure 12:</strong> The evolution of a signalling system under the replicator dynamics. </blockquote> <p>When the number of states of the world, the number of signals, and thenumber of actions increase from 2, the situation rapidly becomes muchmore complex. If there are <em>N</em> states of the world, <em>N</em>signals, and <em>N</em> actions, the total number of possiblestrategies equals <em>N<sup>2N</sup></em>. For <em>N</em>=2, thismeans there are 16 possible strategies, as we haveseen. For <em>N</em>=3, there are 729 possible strategies, and asignalling problem where <em>N</em>=4 has 65,536 possiblestrategies. Given this, one might think that it would prove difficultfor evolution to settle upon an optimal signalling system.</p> <p>Such an intuition is correct. Hofbauer and Hutteger (2008) show that,quite often, the replicator dynamics will converge to a suboptimaloutcome in signalling games. In these suboptimal outcomes,a <em>pooling</em> or <em>partial pooling</em> equilibrium willemerge. A pooling equilibrium occurs when the Sender uses the samesignal regardless of the state of the world. A partial poolingequilibrium occurs when the Sender is capable of differentiatingbetween some states of the world but not others. As an example of apartial pooling equilibrium, consider the following strategies for thecase where <em>N=3</em>: Suppose that the Sender sends signal 1 instate of the world 1, and signal 2 in states of the world 2 and 3.Furthermore, suppose that the Receiver performs action 1 upon receiptof signal 1, and action 2 upon receipt of signals 2 and 3. If allstates of the world are equiprobable, this is a partial poolingequilibrium. Given that the Sender does not differentiate states ofthe world 2 and 3, the Receiver cannot improve his payoffs byresponding differently to signal 2. Given the particular responsebehaviour of the Receiver, the Sender cannot improve her payoffs byattempting to differentiate states of the world 2 and 3.</p> <h2><a name="PhiProEvoGamThe">5. Philosophical Problems of Evolutionary Game Theory</a></h2>The growing interest among social scientists and philosophers inevolutionary game theory has raised several philosophical questions,primarily stemming from its application to human subjects. <h3><a name="MeaFitCulEvoInt">5.1 The meaning of fitness in cultural evolutionary interpretations</a></h3> <p>As noted previously, evolutionary game theoretic models may often begiven both a biological and a cultural evolutionary interpretation. Inthe biological interpretation, the numeric quantities which play a roleanalogous to “utility” in traditional game theory correspond to thefitness (typically Darwinian fitness) of individuals.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#13" name="note-13">13</a>]</sup> How does oneinterpret “fitness” in the cultural evolutionary interpretation?</p> <p>In many cases, fitness in cultural evolutionary interpretations ofevolutionary game theoretic models directly measures some objectivequantity of which it can be safely assumed that (1) individuals alwayswant more rather than less and (2) interpersonal comparisons aremeaningful. Depending on the particular problem modeled, money, slicesof cake, or amount of land would be appropriate cultural evolutionaryinterpretations of fitness. Requiring that fitness in culturalevolutionary game theoretic models conform to this interpretativeconstraint severely limits the kinds of problems that one can address.A more useful cultural evolutionary framework would provide a moregeneral theory which did not require that individual fitness be alinear (or strictly increasing) function of the amount of some realquantity, like amount of food.</p> <p>In traditional game theory, a strategy's fitness was measured by theexpected utility it had for the individual in question. Yetevolutionary game theory seeks to describe individuals of limitedrationality (commonly known as “boundedly rational” individuals), andthe utility theory employed in traditional game theory assumes highlyrational individuals. Consequently, the utility theory used intraditional game theory cannot simply be carried over to evolutionarygame theory. One must develop an alternate theory of utility/fitness,one compatible with the bounded rationality of individuals, that issufficient to define a utility measure adequate for the application ofevolutionary game theory to cultural evolution.</p> <h3><a name="ExpIrrEvoGamThe">5.2 The explanatory irrelevance of evolutionary game theory</a></h3> <p>Another question facing evolutionary game theoretic explanations ofsocial phenomena concerns the kind of explanation it seeks to give.Depending on the type of explanation it seeks to provide, areevolutionary game theoretic explanations of social phenomena irrelevantor mere vehicles for the promulgation of pre-existing values andbiases? To understand this question, recognize that one must askwhether evolutionary game theoretic explanations target the etiology ofthe phenomenon in question, the persistence of the phenomenon, orvarious aspects of the normativity attached to the phenomenon. Thelatter two questions seem deeply connected, for population memberstypically enforce social behaviors and rules having normative force bysanctions placed on those failing to comply with the relevant norm; andthe presence of sanctions, if suitably strong, explains the persistenceof the norm. The question regarding a phenomenon's etiology, on theother hand, can be considered independent of the latter questions.</p> <p>If one wishes to explain how some currently existing socialphenomenon came to be, it is unclear why approaching it from the pointof view of evolutionary game theory would be particularilyilluminating. The etiology of any phenomenon is a unique historicalevent and, as such, can only be discovered empirically, relying on thework of sociologists, anthropologists, archaeologists, and the like.Although an evolutionary game theoretic model may exclude certainhistorical sequences as possible histories (since one may be able toshow that the cultural evolutionary dynamics preclude one sequence fromgenerating the phenomenon in question), it seems unlikely that anevolutionary game theoretic model would indicate a unique historicalsequence suffices to bring about the phenomenon. An empirical inquirywould then still need to be conducted to rule out the extraneoushistorical sequences admitted by the model, which raises the questionof what, if anything, was gained by the construction of an evolutionarygame theoretic model in the intermediate stage. Moreover, even if anevolutionary game theoretic model indicated that a single historicalsequence was capable of producing a given social phenomenon, thereremains the important question of why we ought to take this resultseriously. One may point out that since nearly any result can beproduced by a model by suitable adjusting of the dynamics and initialconditions, all that the evolutionary game theorist has done is provideone such model. Additional work needs to be done to show that theunderlying assumptions of the model (both the cultural evolutionarydynamics and the initial conditions) are empirically supported. Again,one may wonder what has been gained by the evolutionary model--would itnot have been just as easy to determine the cultural dynamics andinitial conditions beforehand, constructing the model afterwards? Ifso, it would seem that the contributions made by evolutionary gametheory in this context simply are a proper part of the parent socialscience--sociology, anthropology, economics, and so on. If so, thenthere is nothing <em>particular</em> about evolutionary game theoryemployed in the explanation, and this means that, contrary toappearances, evolutionary game theory is really irrelevant to the givenexplanation.</p> <p>If evolutionary game theoretic models do not explain the etiology ofa social phenomenon, presumably they explain the persistence of thephenomenon or the normativity attached to it. Yet we rarely need anevolutionary game theoretic model to identify a particular socialphenomenon as stable or persistent as that can be done by observationof present conditions and examination of the historical records; hencethe charge of irrelevancy is raised again. Moreover, most of theevolutionary game theoretic models developed to date have provided thecrudest approximations of the real cultural dynamics driving the socialphenomenon in question. One may well wonder why, in these cases, weshould take seriously the stability analysis given by the model;answering this question would require one engage in an empirical studyas previously discussed, ultimately leading to the charge ofirrelevance again.</p> <h3><a name="ValLadEvoGamTheExp">5.3 The value-ladenness of evolutionary game theoretic explanations</a></h3>If one seeks to use an evolutionary game theoretic model to explain thenormativity attached to a social rule, one must explain how such anapproach avoids committing the so-called “naturalistic fallacy” ofinferring an ought-statement from a conjunction of is-statements. <sup>[<a href="notes.html#14" name="note-14">14</a>]</sup> Assuming that the explanation does notcommit such a fallacy, one argument charges that it must then be thecase that the evolutionary game theoretic explanation merely repackagescertain key value claims tacitly assumed in the construction of themodel. After all, since any argument whose conclusion is a normativestatement must have at least one normative statement in the premises,any evolutionary game theoretic argument purporting to show how certainnorms acquire normative force must contain--at least implicitly--anormative statement in the premises. Consequently, this application ofevolutionary game theory does not provide a neutral analysis of thenorm in question, but merely acts as a vehicle for advancing particularvalues, namely those smuggled in the premises. <p>This criticism seems less serious than the charge of irrelevancy.Cultural evolutionary game theoretic explanations of norms need not“smuggle in” normative claims in order to draw normative conclusions.The theory already contains, in its core, a proper subtheory havingnormative content--namely a theory of rational choice in whichboundedly rational agents act in order to maximize, as best as theycan, their own self-interest. One may challenge the suitability of thisas a foundation for the normative content of certain claims, but thisis a different criticism from the above charge. Although culturalevolutionary game theoretic models do act as vehicles for promulgatingcertain values, they wear those minimal value commitments on theirsleeve. Evolutionary explanations of social norms have the virtue ofmaking their value commitments explicit and also of showing how othernormative commitments (such as fair division in certain bargainingsituations, or cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma) may be derivedfrom the principled action of boundedly rational, self-interestedagents.</p> <h2><a name="Bib">Bibliography</a></h2> <ul> <li>Ackley, David and Michael Littman (1994). “InteractionsBetween Learning and Evolution,” in Christopher G.

It therefore needs less of the tie’s fabric, which will make the knot better suited for taller people tying a regular length necktie. It is a much more triangular looking tie knot than the <a href="tie-a-four-in-hand-necktie-knot.html">Four in Hand</a>, or the Kent knot. It is a great choice of tie knot when wearing shirts with a medium or regular collar spread. When comparing the half Windsor to it’s bigger brother, the full <a href="how-to-tie-a-double-windsor-necktie-knot.html">double Windsor knot</a>, it is slightly more asymmetric. </p> <p><img src="images/krawattenknoten-kleiner-windsorknoten.gif" alt="kleiner oder einfacher Windsorknoten Krawattenknoten" width="397" height="416" /></p> <ol> <li value="1">Place the necktie around your neck with the wide part of the tie on your left side.

They can give you insight intoyour condition, your progress, and the care you are receiving. When you have a chronic illness, like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), these recordstake on added importance, since an accurate medical history can be vital to your treatment. Understanding your medical records and your rightsregarding their accessibility is a critical part of being an active participant in your healthcare.</p> <p class="back_to_top"><a href="#ordering">Back to Top</a></p> <h2 id="whatis">What is a medical record?</h2> <p>Each time you receive healthcare –– whether it is a checkup, a diagnostic procedure, or treatment in a clinic or hospital –– informationis documented and then compiled into a medical record. You probably have a number of medical records, since each healthcare provider thatyou see (e.g., your internist, your gastroenterologist, and your surgeon) typically compiles a separate file or &quot;chart&quot; about your medical history.</p> <p>A medical record is also a legal document. The law requires healthcare providers to record certain information in a specified format and to sign the documentsthey create. Your medical record is the physical property of your healthcare provider; however the information within the record belongs toyou.</p> <p class="back_to_top"><a href="#ordering">Back to Top</a></p> <h2 id="howcollected">How is my health information collected and used?</h2> <p>Each time you see a healthcare provider, your medical record travels through a number of hands, and different information is collected at each stop. First,the clinic registration staff or hospital admitting staff typically documents where you live and your method of payment. They may also collectand file standard forms regarding clinic or hospital registration and treatment consent.</p> <p>Next, your healthcare provider records information about your health history, as well as observations, diagnostic reports, notes regarding your responseto treatment, and plans for future treatment. At this point, consultations from other healthcare providers and directions to other members of yourhealthcare team may also be incorporated.</p> <p>Then, your file travels to the medical records personnel, who ensure that the information collected is complete and accurate and assign codes to each aspectof treatment for billing purposes. The medical records staff is also responsible for making sure that your healthcare information is maintainedsecurely and in accordance with regulatory agencies.</p> <p>Finally, the billing department files claims with your health insurance provider, who then uses coded data to determine the appropriate payment for theservices that you received. There are additional situations where your health information may be shared (e.g., with employers, public health agencies,law enforcement agencies, health research organizations, and quality improvement agencies), but your identity, and therefore your privacy, willbe protected.</p> <p class="back_to_top"><a href="#ordering">Back to Top</a></p> <h2 id="howprotected">How is my privacy protected?</h2> <p>In 1996, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was enacted to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage.This prompted Congress to require the development of regulations to protect the confidentiality of your medical records. A final Privacy Rule,issued in 2002, gives you the right to inspect, review, and receive a copy of your medical record. It also sets limits on who has access to yourhealth–related information. Protected information includes your medical record, conversations healthcare providers have regarding your care and treatment, information about you in your health insurance company's computer system, and most other health information about you that is held by thosewho must follow this law.</p> <p>The Privacy Rule applies to most healthcare providers, health plans (e.g., health maintenance organizations (HMOs), health insurance companies, companyhealth plans, Medicare, and Medicaid), and healthcare clearinghouses. These individuals and organizations must</p> <ul class="newsletter_ul"> <li>establish safeguards to protect the confidentiality of your health information,</li> <li>reasonably limit use and disclosure of your health information,</li> <li>have contracts in place with their contractors and others ensuring that your information is appropriately used and disclosed, </li> <li>have procedures in place to limit who can view and access your health information, and</li> <li>implement training programs for employees about how to protect your health information.</li> </ul> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p>Life insurance companies, employers, workers compensation carriers, and many schools, state agencies, law enforcement agencies, and municipal offices areallowed to share information in special circumstances, such as during legal proceedings or when benefits are contested or questioned.</p> <p class="back_to_top"><a href="#ordering">Back to Top</a></p> <h2 id="rightsviolated">What if I think that my rights have been violated?</h2> <p>If you think that your medical information was used or shared in a way that is not allowed under the Privacy Rule, you can file a complaint with the privacyofficer at the healthcare facility or insurance company where you believe the violation occurred. If you cannot resolve the issue, you can filea complaint with the Department of Health and Human Service's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). A complaint must be filed in writing (either hard copyor electronically) within 180 days of the event. For more information about filing a complaint, visit the OCR Web site (<a onclick="goodbye('http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa/');" href="#">www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa/</a>).</p> <p class="back_to_top"><a href="#ordering">Back to Top</a></p> <h2 id="notice">My clinic gave me a copy of their &quot;Notice of Privacy Practice.&quot; What is it? Do I have to sign it?</h2> <p>When you receive healthcare, your provider must give you a notice that tells you how your health information is used and shared and how you can exerciseyour rights. Typically, you should get this notice the first time you visit a healthcare provider, and you can ask for a copy at any time. You willbe asked to read the information and sign an acknowledgement that you received the notice, but your signature is not legally required. Health insurancecompanies must also give you a Notice of Privacy Practice, but do not ask for your signature.</p> <p class="back_to_top"><a href="#ordering">Back to Top</a></p> <h2 id="woconsent">When can my health information be shared without my consent?</h2> <p>In general, your health information cannot be given to your employer, used or shared for things like sales calls or advertising, or used or shared for many other purposes unless you give your permission by signing an authorization form that tells you who will get your information and how they will useit.</p> <p>However, healthcare staff can see your medical records without your consent if doing so is necessary to provide your treatment, facilitate payment for healthcare services, or ensure that you are receiving quality care. And hospitals can share your health information with family members without your consent if you are unable to provide consent and a spouse, parent, or child is involved in providing your care.</p> <p class="back_to_top"><a href="#ordering">Back to Top</a></p> <h2 id="copy">How can I obtain a copy of my medical records?</h2> <p>Many patients are unaware that they have a legal right to review their medical records. To obtain a copy, simply contact your healthcare provider's officeor the medical records department at each facility where you have received treatment. You typically must complete a form to authorize the releaseof your information. In most cases, you must receive a copy within 30 days, but this can be extended for another 30 days if you are given a reason.</p> <p>Your healthcare provider may charge for reasonable costs related to copying and mailing your records, however you cannot be charged for the time requiredto search for and retrieve your records. You also cannot be denied a copy of your records because you have not paid for the service you received.</p> <p>If your healthcare provider has moved, retired, or died, his estate is obligated to retain your records for a period of time defined by federal and statelaw – usually 10 years following your last visit. You may be able to locate your records by contacting your physician's partners.</p> <p>Once you get a copy of your medical records, you may find that their contents are difficult to understand. You can schedule a consultative visit with your healthcare provider to discuss your records, or you can try referring to a medical dictionary or a Web site like<a onclick="goodbye('http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/mplusdictionary.html');" href="#">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/mplusdictionary.html</a>.</p> <p class="back_to_top"><a href="#ordering">Back to Top</a></p> <h2 id="child">Do I have the right to see my child's medical records?</h2> <p>If your child is a minor, you typically have the right to see his/her medical records. Exceptions include situations where your child</p> <ul class="newsletter_ul"> <li>consents to care for which parental consent is not legally required,</li> <li>obtains care at the guidance of a court or a person appointed by a court, or</li> <li>has your consent to have a confidential relationship with a healthcare provider.</li> </ul> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p class="back_to_top"><a href="#ordering">Back to Top</a></p> <h2 id="errors">What if I find errors in my medical record?</h2> <p>If you find an error in your medical record, you can ask your healthcare provider to correct the record. For example, if you and your physician agree that a diagnostic test result has been recorded incorrectly, your physician must change it. You can also ask that information be added, if you believeyour file is incomplete. If your provider does not agree with your request, you have the right to submit a statement of disagreement that your providermust add to your record.</p> <p class="back_to_top"><a href="#ordering">Back to Top</a></p> <h2 id="transfer">How do I transfer my medical records if I move?</h2> <p>Anytime you change healthcare providers, it is important to make sure that your new provider has access to your medical records. If you know the name of your new doctor, you can ask your current doctor to send a copy of your records. Your clinic may ask you to make the request in writing and specifythe information that you would like sent. If you don't yet have a new healthcare provider, you can ask your current doctor for a copy of your records,which you can keep until you choose a new provider. Alternatively, once you find a new doctor, you can sign an authorization form requesting a copy of your records, which the office staff will send to your former provider.</p> <p class="back_to_top"><a href="#ordering">Back to Top</a></p> <h2 id="electronic">What are electronic medical records?</h2> <p>Electronic medical records are simply comprehensive, computerized versions of the paper medical records that most healthcare providers currently use. These files can then be linked to a centralized system. Currently, only 8% to 12% of hospitals and about 17% of physicians currently use electronic medicalrecords. The recently passed economic stimulus package includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the HiTECH Act), which allocates more than $19 billion over the next six years to increase electronic medical record use.</p> <p>There are a number of benefits related to the use of electronic medical records. They can foster more efficient healthcare, because they facilitate accessto information. However, efficiency isn't the only benefit. Electronic medical records can also enhance patient care. Most systems include toolsthat assist physicians with diagnosis and treatment recommendations, which can lead to better decision making. Finally, electronic medical recordscan make healthcare safer. For example, when your records can be easily shared, everyone involved in your healthcare can access important informationabout your medical history and medications. This can be lifesaving, in an emergency situation.</p> <p>On the other hand, keep in mind that digital technology is often accompanied by concerns regarding privacy and security, and electronic medical recordsare no exception. There has been much discussion about the necessity of safeguards against the unauthorized access to and misuse of patient data, as well as long term data management issues. In response, the HITECH Act has set new standards related to electronic medical records. For example, itrequires organizations that exchange or routinely access protected health information to develop and implement comprehensive, written security policiesand procedures. It also requires organizations covered by HIPAA and their business associates to comply with new patient notification rules inthe event of a security breach.</p> <p class="back_to_top"><a href="#ordering">Back to Top</a></p> <h2 id="idtheft">How can I protect myself against medical identity theft?</h2> <p>Medical identity theft happens when someone uses your name and other parts of your identity (e.g., your social security number or insurance information)to obtain medical services or to make false claims for medical services without your knowledge or consent. It can involve the creation of fictitiousmedical records in your name or the inclusion of erroneous information in your existing medical records.</p> <p>It is often more difficult to discover medical identity theft than it is to discover financial identity theft, since there is no single place to look fora red flag. Some people have realized they've been victimized when they receive a debt collection letter for services they never received. Othershave noticed an error in their medical file or received a call from an insurance investigator. The following steps can help protect you against medical identity theft:</p> <ul class="newsletter_ul"> <li>Review all insurance statements (i.e., &quot;Explanation of Benefit&quot; information). If you notice that you have been charged for services or medical equipment that you did not receive, call the healthcare provider and the insurer involved. Don't assume that there is not a problem just because you don't owe money.</li> <li>Each year, contact your health insurer to request a listing of all of the benefits paid in your name. If there are payments for services or goods that you don't recognize, follow up with the healthcare provider and insurer involved. Doing so will also help confirm that your contact information is correct –– sometimes identity thieves will change your billing address and phone number, which means that you may not receive fraudulent bills.</li> </ul> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p>If you are a victim of medical identity theft, it is important to file a report with your local police. You may need to provide a copy of the report tohealthcare providers and insurers involved in the case. You can also file a medical identity theft complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).For more information about this go to <a onclick="goodbye('http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/');" href="#">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/</a> or call the FTC Identity Theft Toll–FreeHotline at 1–877–IDTHEFT (438–4338). The FTC Web site also provides helpful information about how to resolve any financial repercussionsof the theft.</p> <p class="back_to_top"><a href="#ordering">Back to Top</a></p> <h2 id="personalhr">What is a personal health record?</h2> <p>A personal health record is a health record that you initiate and maintain yourself. You can think of it as an autobiography of your health. You neverknow when you will need treatment for an illness or injury, and important information about your health history may be scattered across a number ofdifferent healthcare providers and facilities. If you keep your own updated and easily accessible personal health record, you can help ensure thatyou will have vital information at your fingertips and that there are no errors or omissions in your &quot;chart.&quot; This allows you to be a partner in your healthcare, rather than rely on a nurse or doctor to convey medical information to you. It also gives you a backup, in case your clinic's recordsare lost or destroyed.</p> <p>The first step to compiling a personal health record is to contact all of your healthcare providers and <a href="#copy">obtain your records</a>. The next step is to organizethe information, so that you can easily access whatever you might need. This can be as simple as a collection of paper files of all of the recordsyou have collected. Or, you may find that your healthcare provider allows you to access your medical record through the Internet and create a personalhealth record from it. There are also commercial software packages that let you to store your information electronically, either on your owncomputer or on the Internet. Remember that electronically stored data can be vulnerable to unauthorized access, as described above, so be sure tocheck the software vendor's privacy and security policies. Also consider ease of use, comprehensiveness, and accessibility. Electronic personal health records may be more efficient than paper, especially as more healthcare providers move to electronic health records, but the most important thingis to have a single location for all of your health information, in whatever format you choose.</p> <p>A typical personal health record contains your name, birth date, blood type, emergency contact information, dates and results of tests, dates and otherinformation about illnesses and surgeries, a list of your medications and dosages, and information about any allergies and chronic diseases. You mayalso want to include contact information for each of your healthcare providers, health insurance information, and a living will. Remember that yourpersonal health record will be complete only if you update it each time you see a healthcare provider.</p> <p class="back_to_top"><a href="#ordering">Back to Top</a></p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Over the past decade, consumers have been playing a more active role in their healthcare. They are using the Internet to review the quality of healthcareproviders and research information related to health and disease. Accessing and using your medical records is another step in this direction. The more you know about your health, the more control you can take over it, and the healthier you are likely to be.</p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p class="back_to_top"><a href="#ordering">Back to Top</a></p> </div> <p></p> </div> <div id="disclaimer"> <div id="azasanboxedwarning" class="disclaimer"> <p><strong>Important Safety Information about AZASAN</strong></p> <div class="boxedwarning"> <p><strong>WARNING: Chronic immunosuppression with this purine antimetabolite increases <em>risk of neoplasia</em> in humans.

Therapy should not exceed 12 weeks in duration. Take on an empty stomach up to four times daily, at least 30 minutes before eating and at bedtime.</p> <p>METOZOLV&nbsp;ODT is contraindicated in patients with intestinal obstruction, hemorrhage, or perforation; pheochromocytoma; known sensitivity or intolerance to metoclopramide; epilepsy; or are receiving concomitant medications with extrapyramidal reactions.</p> <p>Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), manifested primarily as acute dystonic reactions, occur in approximately 1 in 500 patients treated with the usual adult dosages of 30 to 40 mg/day of metoclopramide. These usually are seen during the first 24 to 48 hours of treatment with metoclopramide, occur more frequently in pediatric patients and adult patients less than 30 years of age and are even more frequent at higher doses.</p> <p>Drug-induced Parkinsonism can occur during metoclopramide therapy, more commonly within the first 6 months after beginning treatment, but also after longer periods. Patients with a history of Parkinson’s disease should be given metoclopramide cautiously, if at all, since such patients can experience exacerbation of Parkinsonian symptoms when taking metoclopramide.</p> <p>There have been rare reports of an uncommon but potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) associated with metoclopramide. Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, altered consciousness, and evidence of autonomic instability. The management of NMS should include immediate discontinuation of metoclopramide and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy.</p> <p>Depression associated with metoclopramide use has occurred in patients with and without a history of depression.

Adults often feel helpless when it comes to dealing with a child’s nightmares.&nbsp; It helps to keep a few ideas in mind:</p> <ol> <li>Never, ever brush off or dismiss a child’s fears.&nbsp; When you say, “Oh, that’s nothing, you’re being silly,” you are insulting the child as well as diminishing their concerns.&nbsp; If they are legitimately frightened, it’s far from “nothing” and they aren’t being “silly,” they’re being children.</li> <li>You don’t want to blow the nightmare or the dream up larger than they should be, of course, but you should listen to the child as she or he tells you what happened in the dream.</li> <li>Instead of saying, “Monsters don’t exist!” – ask the child if he/she has ever seen a monster.&nbsp; Tell them that you haven’t either (which will carry a great deal of weight, since the child probably thinks you’re about as old as old gets!).&nbsp; Allow them to come to the realization that it was just a dream and that monsters (or whatever) really don’t exist.&nbsp; Stay calm, casual, and never tease or make fun of them.</li> <li>Help them&nbsp; understand that dreams are like little movies our brain creates to entertain itself while we’re asleep.&nbsp; Tell them that, apparently, their mind thought it was time for a scary movie and that it will probably want to create a comedy next.&nbsp; Let them know that watching several cartoons (lighthearted) before bedtime the next night will probably encourage their brain to keep things funny!</li> <li>If the child is afraid to go back to sleep, ask yourself this question:&nbsp; “If you were their age and felt totally afraid of your dreams and the dark, what would you want your mom or dad to do?”&nbsp;&nbsp; You’d want them to let you stay awake for the time being – with the lights on!&nbsp; If you try to force them to go back to a frightening place, you aren’t going to be much of a hero, are you?</li> </ol> <p>Nightmares are a part of growing up, so are “monsters under the bed” and “creepers in the closet.”&nbsp; Just try to be as calm and reassuring as you can and you’ll help them disappear soon.</p> <p><span class="st_facebook" st_title="When Children Experience Nightmares" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/when-children-experience-nightmares/"></span><span class="st_twitter" st_title="When Children Experience Nightmares" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/when-children-experience-nightmares/"></span><span class="st_email" st_title="When Children Experience Nightmares" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/when-children-experience-nightmares/"></span><span class="st_sharethis" st_title="When Children Experience Nightmares" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/when-children-experience-nightmares/"></span></p> <span style="clear:both;display:none;"><img src="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-spamfree/img/wpsf-img.php" width="0" height="0" alt="" style="border-style:none;width:0px;height:0px;display:none;" /></span> </div> <!-- end .entry-content --> <div class="post-meta"> <span class="categories">Filed Under: <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/category/dreams/nightmares/" title="View all posts in Nightmares" rel="category tag">Nightmares</a></span> &middot;

Was it REALLY prophetic or coincidental?</strong></em></p> <p>I’m a huge history buff, and the Civil War Era is a particular favorite.&nbsp; The bravery and boldness of those men and women fighting for what was right – and winning in the end.&nbsp; Reading about this period of time is better than any novel or movie on the market today!</p> <p>Naturally, Abraham Lincoln is someone I love reading about – the more, the better.&nbsp; The dreamologist and the historian in me meet up each time I (<em>we?</em>) read about the prophetic dream he had during his Presidency.</p> <p>A few weeks before his tragic assassination, Abraham Lincoln dreamed that he saw someone lying in a coffin.&nbsp; In the dream, he asked someone was in the coffin.</p> <p>Their response?&nbsp; “The President.”</p> <p>It would be very easy to say that <a title="Dreams" href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com">dreams</a> are able to “predict” events based upon this example.&nbsp; However, logic must prevail.&nbsp; Many threats, at this time, were being made against President Abraham Lincoln’s life.&nbsp; The people around him were constantly having to <em>step up</em> their security measures.&nbsp; No doubt it was a frequent topic of conversation and, given the fact that Abraham Lincoln was (although a great hero) still a mere human, he probably thought about these threats a great deal.</p> <p>Can you imagine?&nbsp; Knowing that people want to kill you?!&nbsp; OF COURSE his dreams were affected.&nbsp; How could they not be?</p> <p>Dreams are often our mind’s way of “dealing with” and “processing” information and situations.&nbsp; Combine this with the fact that stress can greatly affect your dreams, I would imagine that Abraham Lincoln had a very disturbing dream life.</p> <p>His dream is simply an example of how our fears and thoughts manifest themselves into our dreams.&nbsp; It’s also a clear example of how we can use our dreams to help and, even, protect us.&nbsp; If Abraham Lincoln, one of the greatest men to ever live, had heeded his dream’s warning and taken extraordinairy securtiy measures, his life might not have ended as it did – or when it did.&nbsp; If he had realized that the threat was still extremely high – then he could have stayed out of the public eye for a while longer.&nbsp; OR, insist on much, much tighter security when he did make a public appearance.</p> <p>Like most things in our lives, dreams can help us to achieve a better life.&nbsp;&nbsp; And, yes, sometimes, even a <em>longer</em> life.</p> <p><em>“The best thing about the future is that it comes one day at a time.”</em> – Abraham Lincoln</p> <p><span class="st_facebook" st_title="Abraham Lincoln’s Prophetic Dream" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/abraham-lincolns-prophetic-dream/"></span><span class="st_twitter" st_title="Abraham Lincoln’s Prophetic Dream" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/abraham-lincolns-prophetic-dream/"></span><span class="st_email" st_title="Abraham Lincoln’s Prophetic Dream" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/abraham-lincolns-prophetic-dream/"></span><span class="st_sharethis" st_title="Abraham Lincoln’s Prophetic Dream" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/abraham-lincolns-prophetic-dream/"></span></p> <span style="clear:both;display:none;"><img src="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-spamfree/img/wpsf-img.php" width="0" height="0" alt="" style="border-style:none;width:0px;height:0px;display:none;" /></span> </div> <!-- end .entry-content --> <div class="post-meta"> <span class="categories">Filed Under: <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/category/dreams/historical-dreams/" title="View all posts in Historical Dreams" rel="category tag">Historical Dreams</a></span> &middot;

It’ll let you know where we came from, where we are, and where we’re headed! </strong></em></p> <p><strong>Here’s the first submitted dream we’ve received since the relaunch of Dream Prophesy:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>“I have a recurring dream that I desperately need help understanding.&nbsp; Each dream has knives in it.&nbsp; In the first one, my son wanted to play his guitar but couldn’t find it.&nbsp; He opened the closet and a huge knife fell on him.&nbsp; Blood was everywhere and we were screaming.&nbsp; Then I woke up.</p> <p>In the second dream, I was cooking supper and cut my hand off with a butter knife!&nbsp; The third dream was just about the same, except it was a steak knife and it cut off part of my plate.</p> <p>These dreams are getting to me, especially the one about my son. I’m scared of what the next dream will be about and who will get hurt in it.&nbsp; Please help and thank you.”</p> </blockquote> <p>I can see how these dreams would trouble you. The first thing you need to do is to remind yourself that these dreams aren’t prophetic. They aren’t signaling an accident or anything bad ahead. Dreams deal with what HAS happened, what IS happening, and your emotions and feelings. Some of these emotions and feelings the dreamer is fully aware of. Others, the dreamer doesn’t seem to be aware of whatsoever.</p> <p>When I hear about people dreaming of knives, my first reaction is this: There’s something in their life that they want to remove, or “cut out.” These could include:</p> <ul> <li>A bad habit.&nbsp; Smokers who want to quit smoking often dream of knives.&nbsp; Their desire to “cut out” this habit weighs on their mind and presents itself in their dream world.</li> <li>Wanting to lose weight.&nbsp; Wanting to lose extra weight will also lead to knife dreams.</li> <li>Dislike of an annoying co-worker, fellow student, neighbor, or even family member.&nbsp; The dreamer doesn’t (of course!) want to harm this annoying person – but they wouldn’t mind AT ALL if fate cut them out of their life and put them in someone else’s!</li> <li>A desire to leave your job, school, home, community, etc.&nbsp; Wanting to separate yourself from a current situation or place can lead to knife dreams.</li> <li>A thought or feeling.&nbsp; Sometimes we feel things we wish we didn’t feel or keep having thoughts we wish would go away.&nbsp; We think, “Why don’t I just cut it out?! ” – But we seem unable to.</li> </ul> <p>All of the above are instances that can lead to these types of dreams.&nbsp; When it comes to recurring dreams, more times than not, fully realizing WHY you’re having the dreams is enough to send them packing.&nbsp; Even if you haven’t arrived at the solution yet,&nbsp; your subconscious mind seems perfectly content with you just knowing the situation exists.</p> <p>I truly hope this helps!</p> <p>Thanks so much for submitting your dream.&nbsp; I’ve learned from experience (from the last time the site was up&nbsp; BEFORE disaster struck!) that people are greatly helped when they read other people’s dreams.&nbsp; So, know that you’ve helped others simply by sharing your dream.</p> <p><em>“Dreams are road signs along the nighttime highway of sleep.”</em> – Astrid Alauda</p> <p><span class="st_facebook" st_title="Dream Analysis – A Dream Interpretation" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/dream-analysis-a-dream-interpretation/"></span><span class="st_twitter" st_title="Dream Analysis – A Dream Interpretation" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/dream-analysis-a-dream-interpretation/"></span><span class="st_email" st_title="Dream Analysis – A Dream Interpretation" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/dream-analysis-a-dream-interpretation/"></span><span class="st_sharethis" st_title="Dream Analysis – A Dream Interpretation" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/dream-analysis-a-dream-interpretation/"></span></p> <span style="clear:both;display:none;"><img src="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-spamfree/img/wpsf-img.php" width="0" height="0" alt="" style="border-style:none;width:0px;height:0px;display:none;" /></span> </div> <!-- end .entry-content --> <div class="post-meta"> <span class="categories">Filed Under: <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/category/dream-analysis/" title="View all posts in Dream Analysis" rel="category tag">Dream Analysis</a>, <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/category/dream-interpretation/" title="View all posts in Dream Interpretation" rel="category tag">Dream Interpretation</a>, <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/category/dreams/nightmares/" title="View all posts in Nightmares" rel="category tag">Nightmares</a></span> &middot; <span class="tags">Tagged: <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/tag/knife-dreams/" rel="tag">knife dreams</a>, <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/tag/nightmares/" rel="tag">Nightmares</a>, <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/tag/recurring-dreams/" rel="tag">recurring dreams</a></span> </div> </div> <!-- end .postclass --> <div class="post-41 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-daydreams category-dream-interpretation category-nightmares tag-daydreams tag-dream-prophesy tag-nightmares tag-troubling-dreams"> <h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/dream-prophesy-nightmares-troubling-dreams-and-daydreams/" title="Dream Prophesy – Nightmares, Troubling Dreams, and Daydreams" rel="bookmark">Dream Prophesy – Nightmares, Troubling Dreams, and Daydreams</a></h2> <div class="post-info"> <span class="date published time" title="2009-03-14T23:34:59+00:00">March 14, 2009</span> by <span class="author vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/author/admin/" class="fn n" title="Joi" rel="author">Joi</a></span></span> &middot; <span class="post-comments"><a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/dream-prophesy-nightmares-troubling-dreams-and-daydreams/#comments">3 Comments</a></span> </div> <div class="entry-content"> <p>You may be one of those people who attach meaning to each and every dream, putting each and every dream detail under a microscope combing for the meanings in each. Or, you may disregard your dream(s) immediately upon wakening.</p> <p>As a realistic dreamologist, I’d say that the happiest, sanest place is somewhere between the two illustrations above. No, you don’t have to over-obsess over EVERY detail of EVERY dream, but to totally dismiss your dreams is <em>thisclose</em> to foolish.</p> <p>The subconscious mind is like a treasure trove filled with thoughts, hopes, dreams, fears and insights. Many of these are alien to our conscious mind, which is often far too busy to dwell on such transcendent thoughts. However, while we are asleep, the lid of the treasure trove can swing open, allowing all the gems to roll out!</p> <p>If we would get more in touch with what our own unconscious minds are trying to tell us, who knows what all we could accomplish! Below are a few examples of how our dreams can help us.</p> <p><strong>Troubled Minds and Troubled Dreams:</strong> If you begin dreaming what we term “troubling dreams”, you might want to take a long, hard look <em>inwardly</em>. More likely than not, you are more troubled by recent events or circumstances than you may realize. Troubling dreams are dreams in which, <em>while you don’t experience tragedy or sorrow</em>, you are aggravated, annoyed and mentally tormented by something or someone. A few examples of troubling dreams would be misplacing something important, driving in circles unable to find your way, being wrongly accused of something, etc. They’re grating annoyances that aren’t nightmares but are far from being pleasant.</p> <p><strong>Nightmares: </strong> Nightmares are not always indicative of a mind in turmoil. Medications, stress, and even spicy food can cause outrageous dreams. Some people experience the worst dreams if they eat too closely to bedtime. However, over half the time a nightmare is a result of having too much on your mind. Think of a small wind-up toy car. If you wind it the perfect amount, all goes smoothly. If you over wind, it basically goes amok. The same can be said for our psyches. If we are putting too much on our proverbial plate….our unconscious mind runs amok.</p> <p><strong>Hidden Meanings and Symbols: </strong> Our dreams speak their own language, primarily using symbols and codes. Once you know the meanings and interpretations, you can decode what it is your unconscious mind is trying to tell you.</p> <p>Dream Prophesy is a website which is devoted to the world of dreams. You will find an ever growing collection of articles dealing with dream interpretations, dream symbols, dream analysis, and dream meanings. There will also be a great many articles dealing with the world of sleep – how to achieve greater sleep, the benefits of sleep, etc.</p> <p>You’ll also find an area that’s often gravely overlooked:&nbsp; <strong>Daydreams!</strong> Daydreams carry an unbelievable amount of insight into our subconscious thoughts, feelings, and desires.&nbsp; You will be amazed how much we can learn about ourselves simply</p> <p>The wisest person is the person who is always looking for ways to grow. They never settle for good enough and would never claim to “have arrived”. They will always keep growing and learning, because it’s the only way they know how to live.</p> <p>Dream analysis is simply another avenue to take on this trip we call self-discovery.</p> <p><em>“Dreams are free therapy.

When something tips us off in a dream that it is, in fact a dream, we regain our mental clarity. The clue that tips us off could be seeing someone we realize is deceased, having a magical power such as invisibility, or being able to fly, etc.</p> <p>Lucid Dreams occur in different “strengths” or “levels.” They’ve gotten a great deal of attention because many people believe we can use them to “control” our dreams and, even, help us solve problems.</p> <p>In the Lucid Dreams category, watch for many upcoming articles addressing this very premise. As a dreamologist, I am very passionate about Lucid Dreams. I believe they can, like all dreams, give us a lot of insight into our emotions, our thoughts, our core beliefs, etc. A greater sense of self can be gained by paying closer attention to our dreams.</p> <p>That’s what this site is here for – to help us identify exactly what our dreams mean and what they’re trying to tell us. We’ll learn how to use this information to bring peace into our heart and minds as we build the lives we’ve always… well…<em>dreamed </em>of.</p> <p><em>“Dreaming is an act of pure imagination, attesting in all men a creative power, which if it were available in waking, would make every man a Dante or Shakespeare.” </em> – H.F.

We hope you’ll become a regular.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">Dream Prophesy was a thriving, hugely popular website and blog for many years.&nbsp; However, when we added a forum to the site, things went downhill fast.&nbsp; The software we used was, apparently, easy to hack and that’s pretty much what happened.&nbsp; We lost our HUGE website and blog in a matter of minutes.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">Years of (very) hard work – gone in the blink of an eye.&nbsp; Talk about leaving a bruise!&nbsp; Unfortunately, the bruise was so uncomfortable that we considered not trying again.&nbsp; After all, where’s the fun in starting all over again from zero?!</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">Then we started thinking about the wonderfully colorful and fascinating people who came to the site and blog regularly.&nbsp; The people we talked to through e-mail and comments daily.&nbsp; We missed all of you and didn’t like the thought of not providing a service for you that you obviously benefited from and enjoyed.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">So, the bruise has healed, we’re starting all over (like I said, from zero – we don’t have any of our old posts, articles, dream interpretations, dream analyses….anything…. saved) and, to tell you the truth, we’re as excited now as the first time around.&nbsp; Actually, even more so, because now we know the wonderful dreamers that are on the other side of these words!</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">Please spread the word amongst everyone you know that Dream Prophesy is back up.&nbsp; If you go to other blogs and/or forums, please spread the word like first graders spread colds!&nbsp; The more people who come and share their dreams and thoughts, the better it’ll be, the more fun we’ll all have, and the faster we’ll get this site built back up!!!</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Dreams are answers to questions we haven’t yet figured out how to ask.”</em> – X-Files</span></p> <p><span class="st_facebook" st_title="Dream Prophesy is Back and Better Than Before!" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/dream-prophesy-is-back-and-better-than-before/"></span><span class="st_twitter" st_title="Dream Prophesy is Back and Better Than Before!" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/dream-prophesy-is-back-and-better-than-before/"></span><span class="st_email" st_title="Dream Prophesy is Back and Better Than Before!" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/dream-prophesy-is-back-and-better-than-before/"></span><span class="st_sharethis" st_title="Dream Prophesy is Back and Better Than Before!" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/dream-prophesy-is-back-and-better-than-before/"></span></p> <span style="clear:both;display:none;"><img src="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-spamfree/img/wpsf-img.php" width="0" height="0" alt="" style="border-style:none;width:0px;height:0px;display:none;" /></span> </div> <!-- end .entry-content --> <div class="post-meta"> <span class="categories">Filed Under: <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/category/dreams/daydreams/" title="View all posts in Daydreams" rel="category tag">Daydreams</a>, <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/category/dream-analysis/" title="View all posts in Dream Analysis" rel="category tag">Dream Analysis</a>, <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/category/dream-interpretation/" title="View all posts in Dream Interpretation" rel="category tag">Dream Interpretation</a>, <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/category/dream-prophesy/" title="View all posts in Dream Prophesy" rel="category tag">Dream Prophesy</a>, <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/category/dreams/lucid-dreams/" title="View all posts in Lucid Dreams" rel="category tag">Lucid Dreams</a>, <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/category/dreams/nightmares/" title="View all posts in Nightmares" rel="category tag">Nightmares</a></span> &middot;
