The subject is complex and difficult so I cannot resolve it overnight. I am an African. I do things the African way. I cannot write about African American music like a Western scholar. In my culture we live the past and the future in the present. When I listen to some African American music I can feel the past, the present and the future all at the same time. Now, the best way for me to handle this subject is to work by questions and answers.</p> <p>[Question] Yaya! Who do you think you are?</p> <p>Yaya Diallo - I don't think! I am Farafin, which means I am a dark skin man. The word Africa is the Arabic name for our continent. In Bambara we call the so-called &quot;Africa&quot; Farafina. Farafina means the land of dark skin people. I am from Farafina and I am proud of it. I don't want to be somebody else. People in general say African American. I would say American Farafin, which means dark skin human being who lives in America.</p> <p>[Question] What is your African background?</p> <p>Yaya Diallo - I come from far away. I was born in 1946 in Fienso (French Sudan), now Mali. My parents were nomadic. When I was very young I used to travel a lot. I grew up in the bush far from any western civilization. The music that I heard was very traditional and played live. I did not have a radio or TV. I had the opportunity to listen to the music of the different ethnic groups from the Ivory Coast, Burkina and Ghana. In some villages I heard Muslim songs coming from the mosques. By night, I would enjoy the frog symphonic orchestras. From 1946 to 1960 I was living in complete nature. My musical training is a long story but you can learn more from my book The Healing Drum.</p> <p>[Question] What are your feelings about the civilized world?</p> <p>Yaya Diallo - In the city I had strange feelings. I saw people listen to music through what I thought was two kinds of boxes. The first was a radio. You could change the singer with the tuning button, I thought. The second needed records. It read 78, 45 and 33 1/2. You had to adjust everything with something but I did not have a clue as to what. Even still, the only music that I heard was the Beatles, Rolling Stones and Johnny Holliday.</p> <p>[Question] What do you think about the word African American?</p> <p>Yaya Diallo - Dark skin people living in America are not different from people I met in Africa (Farafina). To me they are just different ethnic groups like the Yoruba, the Bantou, the Zoulou or the Touareg. Africa is not one culture. We have thousands and thousands of languages and different music. My wife is an African American from Louisville, KY. Her mother is from Dark Corner, MS and her father from Jackson, TN. Like my wife and family there was one African American man, James Brown, who saved my life with his music.</p> <p>[Question] How can an African American man save the life of a traditional African?</p> <p>Yaya Diallo - In 1967 I left my country to go to Montreal, Canada. On my way, in Paris, I saw a big picture of James Brown in the Olympia Theater. In my mind I thought, &quot;Oh! A black man in Olympia in Paris, France.&quot; In Montreal I was looking for a place to dance or listen to the music that I loved. One day I found a radio station that played black music. I heard James Brown and felt at home.</p> <p>[Question] What do you think about African American music?</p> <p>Yaya Diallo - I always say that I don't think, I feel. When we talk about African American music we talk about Spirituals, Blues, Funk, Jazz, Gospel, Rap, dance music, etc. I want to talk on each one by one.</p> <p>When people in Canada were dancing the twist, jerk and go-go, in my country a French man named Johnny Holliday was playing bad versions of Wilson Pickett and Ray Charles' music in French. In America I found out this French man was a robber. He stole the music, sang it in French and looked like a genius for us Africans.</p> <p>[Question] What did you feel when you started to dance?</p> <p>Yaya Diallo - I used to go out to dance to Wilson Pickett, James Brown, and Sly and the Family Stone's music. For me they were Africans. They had good beats, good feelings and most important, African Soul. I did not feel that from Chinese or European music. In the 70s I discovered the Funk music, The O'Jays, Parliament, Ohio Players, Kool and the Gang and JR Walker and the All Stars. I felt I was at home when I knew the Motown Family (Smokey Robinson, Diana Ross and the Supremes, the Temptations and Stevie Wonder). I could survive because I had those kinds of musicians.</p> <p>[Question] In terms of music, what is the link between African and African Americans?</p> <p>Yaya Diallo - African Americans are </p> <div style="margin:5px 5px 5px 2px; float:left;width:160px; "> <script type="text/javascript"><!--google_ad_client = "pub-1635511884296372";//articles4ever_mid_linksgoogle_ad_slot = "4933647147";google_ad_width = 160;google_ad_height = 90;//--></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script> </div>Africans from the village and sadly they just don't know it! When you listen to the music you can find out. Kool and The Gang played Funky Stuff. When you listen to the drum part you will get the Dounouba part of the dance Sounou. Sounou was played in the 15th century and today is the dance young people love. In Africa we learn the past in the present and teach it to the next generation. The African Americans sometimes do not know how African they are. <p></p> <p>[Question] Why can you say that they are African?</p> <p>Yaya Diallo - The first time I heard the Four Tops I thought I was listening to the Bambara Farmers in the evening after a hard working day. The Temptations reminded me of the men Fire dancers and singers. I can listen to Temptations but I am afraid to see them. I am not initiated to the Fire dance and the music brings out memories about the secret ceremonies that happened afar in the village. Aretha Franklin is for me a great Djeli-mousso coming from the Empire of Mali in the 13th century. When I listen to African American music I don't worry about the meaning, only what I feel.</p> <p>[Question] What do you think about Jazz?</p> <p>Yaya Diallo - Really, to tell the truth, I don't feel jazz. Many people coming from Africa feel the same way. I learned about jazz in 1980 when I recorded my first album, Nangape, on Onzou Records. That opened the door for me with jazz. Jazz magazines like Cadence and Down Beat wrote articles on me like I was a &quot;jazz man.&quot; I was invited to do workshops at the Creative Music Studio in Woodstock, NY. I met jazz big names like Art Blakey. He said, &quot;Yaya is the only African that I can jazz, that I can play with and be comfortable.&quot; I completed a trio with Don Cherry and Ed Blackwell in the Symphony Space in New York.</p> <p>[Question] What about Gospel?</p> <p>Yaya Diallo - To me gospel means religion or church but my father-in-law changed my mind. When going to church with him I saw a big band and a big choir. People were singing and I forgot that I was in church. I was surprised; I saw ladies in a trance like in my village but they called it shouting. This reminded me of the Mania Secret Society where only woman go into a trance when praising god (See The Healing Drum).</p> <p>[Question] What is rap?</p> <p>Yaya Diallo - I love rap! I use to lie about buying rap and say that it was for my children. Rap is the old tradition of the Fulani people in Mali. It tells life stories through poetry that is recited quickly. Nomadic people have to explain their daily journey through this same quick form, but without the foul language. Today, the young people think that they have reinvented the wheel.</p> <p>[Question] Yaya, what is wrong with African American music today?</p> <p>Yaya Diallo - Today everything is easy. Instead of buying a drum set you buy a drum machine. Computers do everything. You can get almost every sound by pressing a button. This is the type of world that we live in today. The young Africans love it like we used to love James Brown. Time is the only thing that has changed!</p> <p>[Question] How did African American music change American Society?</p> <p>Yaya Diallo - We changed everything! We changed the style of dance; we created new sounds, new styles, and new way to dress ... EVERYTHING! Country music is the white version of the Blues. Rock-n-roll comes from our music. People forget that Jimmie Hendricks was a Blues player that just changed his sound and look. Without James Brown, Sly and Family Stone and the Motown Family there would be no Madonna, no Celiene Dion, no techno, and no disco. African Americans brought this to the world. It is sad because people do not recognize it. We changed the world and it will never be the same again.</p> <p>[Question] How do people know you in America?</p> <p>Yaya Diallo - I am the author of two books, The Healing Drum and At the Threshold of the African Soul. I have four CDs, Nanagape, The Healing Drum, Dombaa Folee, and Dounoukan. I thank Onzou Records, the first company that trusted me to make my first album in 1980. That was not easy!</p> <script type="text/javascript"><!--google_ad_client = "pub-1635511884296372";google_alternate_ad_url = "http://www.articles4ever.com/google_adsense_script.html";google_ad_width = 336;google_ad_height = 280;google_ad_format = "336x280_as";google_ad_type = "text_image";google_ad_channel ="";google_color_border = "ffffff";google_color_bg = "ffffff";google_color_link = "BF0000";google_color_url = "666666";google_color_text = "5e6363";//--></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script> <br class="clear" /> <div id="credits"> <p>&quot;The History of African American Music&quot; by Malian musician/author Yaya Diallo was written to celebrate Black History Month.

class="overview"> <h1>Spider Bites</h1> <h2>Which spider bites are dangerous?</h2> <p>Most spiders found in the United States are harmless, with the exception of the black widow and the brown recluse spiders. Both of these spiders are found in warm climates.</p> <h2>What is a brown recluse spider?</h2> <p>The brown recluse spider, or violin spider, is about 1 inch long and has a violin shaped mark on its upper back. It is often found in warm, dry climates and prefers to stay in undisturbed areas such as basements, closets, and attics. It is not an aggressive spider, but will attack if trapped or held against the skin. No deaths have been reported in the U.S. from a brown recluse bite.</p> <h2>What are the symptoms of a brown recluse spider bite?</h2> <p>Venom from the brown recluse spider usually causes local tissue damage. The following are the most common symptoms of a bite from a brown recluse spider. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:</p> <ul> <li><p>Burning, pain, itching, or redness at the site which is usually delayed and may develop within several hours or days of the bite</p></li> <li><p>A&nbsp;deep blue or purple area around the bite, surrounded by a whitish ring and large red outer ring similar to a &quot;bulls eye&quot;</p></li> <li><p>An ulcer or blister that turns black</p></li> <li><p>Headache, body aches</p></li> <li><p>Rash</p></li> <li><p>Fever</p></li> <li><p>Nausea or vomiting</p></li> </ul> <p>The symptoms of a brown recluse spider bite may resemble other conditions or medical problems. Always consult your doctor for a diagnosis.</p> <h2>What is the treatment for a brown recluse spider bite?</h2> <p>Specific treatment for a brown recluse spider bite will be determined by your doctor. Treatment may include:</p> <ul> <li><p>Washing the area well with soap and water.</p></li> <li><p>Applying a cold or ice pack wrapped in a cloth, or a cold, wet washcloth to the site.</p></li> <li><p>Protecting against infection, particularly in children, by applying an antibiotic lotion or cream.</p></li> <li><p>Giving acetaminophen for pain.</p></li> <li><p>Elevating the site if the bite occurred on an arm or leg (to help prevent swelling).</p></li> <li><p>Seeking immediate emergency care for further treatment. Depending on the severity of the bite, treatment can range from administering corticosteroids and other medications to surgery of the ulcerated area. Hospitalization may be needed.</p></li> </ul> <p>Prompt treatment is essential to avoid more serious complications, especially in children.&nbsp;</p> <h2>What is a black widow spider?</h2> <p>A black widow spider is a small, shiny, black, button-shaped spider with a red hourglass mark on its abdomen, and prefers warm climates. Black widow spider bites release a toxin that can cause damage to the nervous system, thus emergency medical treatment is necessary.</p> <h2>What are the symptoms of a black widow spider bite?</h2> <p>The following are the most common symptoms of a black widow spider bite. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:</p> <ul> <li><p>Immediate pain, burning, swelling, and redness at the site (double fang marks may be seen)</p></li> <li><p>Cramping pain and muscle rigidity in the stomach, chest, shoulders, and back</p></li> <li><p>Headache</p></li> <li><p>Dizziness</p></li> <li><p>Rash and itching</p></li> <li><p>Restlessness and anxiety</p></li> <li><p>Sweating</p></li> <li><p>Eyelid swelling</p></li> <li><p>Nausea or vomiting</p></li> <li><p>Salivation, tearing of the eyes</p></li> <li><p>Weakness, tremors, or paralysis, especially in the legs</p></li> </ul> <p>These symptoms of a black widow spider bite may resemble other conditions or medical problems. Always consult your&nbsp;doctor for a diagnosis.</p> <h2>What is the treatment for a black widow spider bite?</h2> <p>Specific treatment for a black widow spider bite will be determined by your doctor. Treatment may include:</p> <ul> <li><p>Washing the area well with soap and water.</p></li> <li><p>Applying a cold or ice pack wrapped in a cloth, or a cold, wet washcloth to the site.</p></li> <li><p>Protecting against infection, particularly in children, by applying an antibiotic lotion or cream.</p></li> <li><p>Giving acetaminophen for pain.</p></li> <li><p>Elevating&nbsp;the site if the bite occurred on an arm or leg (to help prevent swelling).&nbsp;</p></li> <li><p>Seeking immediate emergency care for further treatment. Depending on the severity of the bite, treatment may include muscle relaxants, pain relievers and other medications, and supportive care. Antivenin may be needed, although it is usually not required. Hospitalization may be needed.</p></li> </ul> <p>Prompt treatment is essential to avoid more serious complications, especially in children.</p> </div> </div> <div class="skipper"> <a href="#container" title="back to the top">top</a> </div> </div> <div id="content_sub"> <div id="action_toolbar" class="generic_recommendation_list Navigation"> <h4>Action Toolbar</h4> <ul> <li class="assetid-1281376423025 item0 first"><a href="/find-a-doctor">Find a Doctor</a></li> <li class="assetid-1281376411305 item1"> <a href="/jobs">Find a Job</a> </li> <li class="assetid-1281376448809 item2"> <a href="http://www.whitememorial.com/locations">Get Directions</a> </li> <li class="assetid-1281376411355 item3"> <a href="/giving/make-a-donation">Make a Donation</a> </li> <li class="assetid-1281376411370 item4"><a href="/volunteer">Volunteer</a></li> <li class="assetid-1281376411461 item5 last"><a href="/who-we-are/contact-us">Contact Us</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <div id="content_navigation"></div> <div id="bread_crumbs" class="Navigation"> <ul> <li class="root"> <a href="/home">Home</a> <ul> <li class="sel"><a href="/conditions-and-treatments">Conditions &amp;

Xray had his own shovel. The lake bed was full of holes. Mr. Pendanski told them that Mr. Sir will come with a water truck, and if they find anything interesting they should turn it in and if the Warden likes it they get the rest of the day off. They tell the story of Stanley’s great great grandfather and his love for a pretty (but stupid) girl named Myra in Latvia. Another man called Igor also loved her and brought a fat pig to her father for Myra. Elya Yelnats got advice from Madame Zeroni who told him to carry a piglet every day up to a mountain to a certain stream, and sing a certain song to it. On Myra’s 15th birthday, Elya was to carry Madame Zeroni up the mountain and sing to her, or his family would be cursed. Elya did it, except on the last day he bathed and brought the pig to Myra’s father, who said both pigs were the same. Myra couldn’t decide between the two men, so she had them pick a number. Elya gave the pig and went to America as a deck hand. He never did carry Madame Zeroni up the mountain, and remembered it later. Elya met and married a woman in America, and they translated the song into English. Stanley finished his first hole with difficulty. Zero was the smallest boy but he finished first.</p> <p>Discuss these questions: “You’re not in the Girl Scouts”.what does this really mean? (It means it isn’t easy here.) How did carrying the pig help the great great grandfather? (It made him stronger) How is sweating good for you? (It cools you off) Where do the boys go to the restroom when they are digging?

He goes to the WRECK room and notices how shabby and poor the conditions are. He begins to write a letter to his Mom as if it were a real camp. He trips over a boy they call “Caveman”, but then learns that really the rest of the boys have nicknamed him “Caveman”.</p> <p>Discuss these questions: Why did Stanley like the cold, short shower? (He was so hot and tired it felt good) Why did the door to the recreation room say WRECK room? ( Because the room was a wreak, a mess.) (It’s a joke, on RECREATION room) Why did Xray say that digging a hole is fun? (Because most guys have always wanted to dig a deep hole.)

He had learned not to dump the dirt too close to the opening. As he was digging he found something. He thought it was a rock or a fossil. He gave it to Mr. Pedanski, but they said it wasn’t interesting enough.</p> <p>Discuss these questions: Why was Stanley so achy? (From all the digging the day before) Before the sun came up, Stanley didn’t wear his hat. Why did he HAVE to put in on after the sun came up? (To protect against more sunburn) Why did the hat have a cloth sewn on the back of it? (To protect his neck from sunburn)</p> <p>Possible thing to write about in their journals:</p> <p>Mr. Pendanski said that the warden wasn’t interested in rocks or fossils. What do you think the warden would be interested in if the boys dug it up? Guess why you think they have to dig holes and look for things!</p> <p>VOCABULARY: NOTES ON READING / BEHAVIOR:</p> <p>Date: ___________________</p> <p>Teacher Name: _________________________ Group: _____</p> <p>Chapter: # 11 Pages: 70 – 73</p> <p>Summary: Xray asks Stanley to let him know first if he finds anything else. Xray admits that he doesn’t see very well, and can’t find anything. He says it isn’t fair that a new boy should find things and get a day off. Stanley thought it was interesting that a small boy like Xray would be a leader of the group. He decided that he was happy with his nickname, Caveman. As he dug more, he imagined getting revenge on his old school’s bully.</p> <p>Discuss these questions: Does Xray see very well? (No) Why does Xray want to have Stanley tell him first if he finds anything? (So Xray will get the day off.) Does the biggest boy usually become the leader?

He finds everyone else in a circle discussing their lives. Mr. Pendanski says that you can accomplish anything if you set your mind to it. Mr. Pendanski tries to get Stanley to take responsibility for his trouble, but Stanley blames his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather. When they talk about what Zero wants to do, he says he just wants to dig holes.</p> <p>Questions to discuss:</p> <p>What thing did Stanley think he wanted to do with his life? (F.B.I.) What does Magnet want to do? (Animal trainer, vet) This was the first time Stanley saw Zero do what? (Smile)</p> <p>Possible thing to write about in journal:</p> <p>Why is Mr. Pendanski asking these questions?

He saw something glisten in the dirt, it was a gold tube, engraved with an outline of a heart and the letters KB on it. He tried to think of some way out of giving it to X-Ray, but Zigzag saw him and he had to tell. They thought it was probably a shotgun shell, and Stanley suggested that X-Ray wait until the next day to tell about it so he’d get a whole day off. When the water truck came, Stanley got to move up a place in line.</p> <p>Discuss these questions: How was this object described? (gold tube, about as long and as wide as the second finger on your right hand.open on one end and closed on the other.) How long had Stanley been at Camp Green Lake? (2 weeks) Who was it who thought the object looked like a shotgun shell? (Squid) Why did Stanley get to move up in line? (He had helped X-Ray)</p> <p>Possible thing to write about in their journals: Stanley was trying to decide whether to help X-Ray or be selfish. Then, he was discovered before he could decide. Why should he have been selfish? Why should he have given the object to X-Ray?</p> <p>VOCABULARY: NOTES ON READING/BEHAVIOR:</p> <p>Date: ___________________ Teacher Name: _________________________ Group:_____</p> <p>Chapter: #14 Pages: 85-89</p> <p>Summary: The next morning, X-Ray snaps at Stanley, and won’t talk with him. X-Ray claims to have found the object, and shortly afterward the warden comes. The warden is a woman, she has Mr. Pendanski drive X-Ray back to camp, and she orders Mr. Pendanski to refill the canteens.</p> <p>Discuss these questions: Why do you think X-Ray is so crabby that morning? (Maybe he feels guilty about what he is going to do.) What time of day is it when X-Ray claims to find the object? (Right after sunrise, when the water truck first comes) What does the Warden look like? Tall woman with red hair, wearing a cowboy hat and black cowboy boots with turquoise stones, lots of freckles, red fingernails.) What is the Warden like?

Write a paragraph predicting what the object is and why she is interested.</p> <p>VOCABULARY: NOTES ON READING / BEHAVIOR:</p> <p>Date: ___________________ Teacher Name: _________________________ Group:_____</p> <p>Chapter: #15 Pages: 90-93</p> <p>Summary: The Warden inspected the dirtpile she thought the object had come from, then she has the rest of the boys dig twice to inspect the dirt. She stays around inspecting everything they do, and the boys have to dig larger holes and carry away the dirt.</p> <p>Discuss these questions The boys aren’t just digging to build character, they are digging for a reason, what is it? (They are digging because the Warden wants to look for something that is buried.) Stanley thinks that X-Ray was crabby because of what? (Because maybe there was a hidden camera or microphone and the warden was listening.) Were they ever thirsty that day? (No, their canteens were kept full.) Why did the boys think that the Warden knew all their names? (They thought she had cameras or microphones hidden around) Were the boys digging the right place to find more objects? (No, the object had been found the day before in another area.)</p> <p>Possible thing to write about in their journals: Write why you think Stanley is going to try to remember exactly where his hole had been the day before.</p> <p>VOCABULARY: NOTES ABOUT READING / BEHAVIOR:</p> <p>Date: ___________________ Teacher Name: _________________________ Group:_____</p> <p>Chapter: #16 Pages: 94-97</p> <p>Summary: That night, X-Ray is in a good mood, and he treats Stanley well. The next day, they dig more. By lunch time the Warden is impatient because they haven’t found any more interesting objects. They have to work faster. Stanley thinks he should tell where the object really was. That night, Stanley gets a letter from his mother, and Zero asks about it, and doesn’t seem to understand what Stanley says.</p> <p>Discuss these questions Why does X-Ray treat Stanley better that night?

Mr. Pendanski suggests shooting the boys, but the Warden says to wait, their story should be simple to the A.G. about Stanley being bit by a lizard. She said they would bury Zero in one of the holes. Stanley remains hopeful, and imagines a good memory. Mr. Sir said Stanley’s lawyer came by and said he was innocent after all. The boys in the camp were waking up, the Warden told the counselors to tell the boys that they didn’t have to dig today. Zero gave a thumbs up, and Stanley carefully leaned against the hole’s wall.</p> <p>Discuss these questions Why did Stanley and Zero have to be very still? (If they moved quickly, a lizard might bite them) Why did Mr. Sir begin to smoke again? (Tension, he said he’d have nightmares) Why did the Warden say that they would bury Zero’s body in a hole? (So they could hide it, no one would miss him) Why did they think they would have bodies? (They knew the lizards would bit the boys) What do you think “the woman” and A.G. mean? (Someone asking about Zero or Stanley) What does Stanley imagine? (When he and his mother fell in the snow and laughed) What does the Warden tell Mr. Sir to say is the punishment for boys who didn’t do as they were told? (She said to let the boys use their imaginations) Why does Stanley need to lean on the wall of the hole?

Zero said “Satan”, then “Sa- tan- lee”. A tarantula was eaten by one of the lizards. Stanley tried to get out but a lizard’s claw on his ankle stopped him. Zero asked if Stanley’s first name was the same as his last name, but backwards. Two strangers drove up, a man in a cowboy hat and a Hispanic woman. The woman threatened to file charges against Mrs. Walker and the Camp for child abuse and torture. The Warden said the kids stole the suitcase from her the night before, and were caught in the lizard nest. The man told Stanley not to say anything, but asked why Stanley wasn’t released the day before. The Warden said Stanley had been hospitalized, he had been delirious and had been having hallucinations, and there had been no authorization from the Attorney General. Stanley slowly got out of the hole, the lizards went back in the shade. He pulled out Zero. Stanley was dizzy. The Warden tried to get the suitcase, but Zero wouldn’t let her, it had Stanley Yelnats written on it.</p> <p>Discuss these questions How many spots were on each lizard? (11) When Zero said “Satan” and “Sa-tan-lee” what was he figuring out? (Stanley’s name, on the suitcase) What does A.G. stand for?

They gave the boys orange juice and bagels. The Warden says that the suitcase has her things inside of it, and the adults argue about whether Stanley should open it. Then they give Stanley his things, and start to take him away, but Stanley won’t leave Hector (Zero). The Warden can’t find Zero’s files. The other boys come in and are glad to see them, and Squid asks Stanley to tell his mom that he was sorry. They let Zero go because they can’t find his records.</p> <p>Discuss these questions Do the boys eat breakfast? (They drink the juice, but they don’t eat) Do the lawyer and Attorney General believe the Warden’s story about the suitcase? (No, they said that isn’t what she first said) Why can’t they find Zero’s files?

The men of the area who hunted rattlesnakes would get lizard juice from Sam the onion man to keep away the monsters. If the men would drink onion juice, it would keep the lizards away. On the ride back, the lady rolled down the windows, even though the air-conditioning was on. The lady explained how she figured out that Stanley was innocent, and how Stanley’s dad had invented something for foot odor that smelled like peaches.</p> <p>Discuss these questions Why would the onion juice help keep lizards away? (Smell) Why did they roll down the windows in the car? (Smell) How did the lady know that Stanley was innocent? (He was being beat up when the shoes were stolen) What kind of lawyer is she?

Camp Green Lake was closed, and the Warden (Ms. Walker) sold the land to become a Girl Scout camp. Stanley’s self confidence was better, the suitcase contained jewels that weren’t worth very much, and some old papers that were worth a lot. Stanley bought his family a new house, and hired a private investigator. A year and a half later, they watched a commercial by Clyde “Sweet Feet” Livingston about Sploosh. Hector’s mother sang a song to Hector she knew from her childhood.</p> <p>Discuss these questions How did Stanley carrying Zero lift the curse? (The great-great-grandfather had forgotten to carry Madame Zeroni up the mountain, so the great-great-grandson did it to Madame Zeroni’s great-great-grandson.) How much money did Stanley and Zero get? (Almost a million dollars each) Why did Stanley hire a private investigator? (To look for Zero’s mother) Why do they call the foot deodorant “Sploosh”? (Because it was made from peaches, like the peaches Kate Barlow made, and the old peaches that Zero called Sploosh) How did Hector’s mother know that song? (It was taught from parent to child, starting with her great-great-grandmother, Madame Zeroni)</p> <p>Possible thing to write about in their journals: Write about all the different things that were connected in this book . the stories from Latvia, the stories from Texas 100 years ago, and what happened to Stanley and Zero. Include Ms. Walker, the Warden, who was she and how was she connected, too?</p> <p>VOCABULARY: NOTES ABOUT READING / BEHAVIOR:</p> <p>E-Mail Deb Flaugher!</p> <div class="printfriendly"> <a href="http://www.printfriendly.com/print/v2?url=http://www.lessonplanspage.com/laholesbylouissachar2-teacherpageseachchapter36-htm/" rel="nofollow" onclick="window.print(); return false;"><img src="//cdn.printfriendly.com/pf-button.gif" alt="Print Friendly" /></a> </div> </div> </div> <div id="comment" class="form_leave_comment"> <div class="hrate"> <ul class="sharelist"> <li class="ishare"> <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="showRPX('rpxlogin')">Share</a> </li> <li class="isave"> <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="showRPX('rpxlogin')">Save</a> </li> <li class="iprint"><a href="http://www.printfriendly.com/print/v2?url=http://www.lessonplanspage.com/laholesbylouissachar2-teacherpageseachchapter36-htm/" rel="nofollow" onclick="window.print(); return false;">Print</a></li> <li class="iemail"><a href="mailto:?subject=Hi!

This damage causes tissue that is similar to the lining of the small intestine to replace the normal tissue lining of the esophagus. Barrett's esophagus is a silent condition because there are no signs or symptoms associated with it. However, is commonly found in people who have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Barrett's esophagus is an area of ongoing research because it is a risk factor for a specific type of esophageal cancer called esophageal adenocarcinoma.</p> <h3>What Causes Barrett's Esophagus?</h3> <p>Anytime you eat, food passes from the mouth to the throat and eventually to the stomach via the esophagus. The act of swallowing causes the muscles at both ends of the esophagus (sphincters) to relax, which allows food or drink to reach the stomach. Once the food or drink is in the stomach, the muscles close quickly in order to prevent these materials from leaking back into the esophagus and mouth.</p> <p>Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) occurs when the lower muscle of the esophagus opens randomly or does not close properly, and some of the stomach's contents rise into the esophagus and mouth. People with GER may taste food or fluid in the back of the mouth. They may also experience heartburn (acid indigestion), which is marked by a burning sensation in the chest or throat. It is normal for this to happen occasionally; however, if it happens more than twice a week it may be considered to be gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD can be a serious condition because it can often lead to other health problems such as bleeding ulcers and Barrett's esophagus if left untreated. For more information on GERD visit the NetWellness exclusive: <a href="http://www.netwellness.org/healthtopics/x-gerd/gerdoverview.cfm">Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Overview</a>. In certain individuals, GERD causes Barrett's esophagus if the leaked stomach contents damage the lining of the esophagus. Researchers are continuing to investigate the causes of Barrett's esophagus, but at this time GERD is considered to be a strong risk factor.</p> <h3>Who is Likely to be Affected?</h3> <p>Results from different studies vary, but Barrett's esophagus probably only affects about one or two percent of adults in the United States. Most people with the diagnosis are age 50 or older, and men are twice as likely to develop it as women. In addition, Caucasian men are more likely to be affected than men of other races. People who have had GERD for an extended period of time are more likely to have Barrett's esophagus than those who don't have GERD. However, it is possible to develop Barrett's esophagus and not have GERD. Being overweight or obese also increases the risk of Barrett's esophagus.</p> <h3>How is it Diagnosed?</h3> <p>Barrett's esophagus is diagnosed using an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, which obtains biopsies of the esophagus. During an endoscopy, the patient is sedated and medical staff inserts a flexible tube (endoscope) into the esophagus. The endoscope contains a light and a miniature camera, allowing the doctor to determine if the tissue seems concerning. If suspicious tissue is found, the doctor will use a pincher-like tool to remove several small pieces of it. This process is called a biopsy. The samples are then examined in a laboratory to determine if the person has Barrett's esophagus.</p> <p>It is currently suggested that adults with more than one risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma, such as age greater than 50, GERD symptoms for many years, Caucasian race, hiatal hernia, or obesity should consider undergoing an endoscopy with biopsies to check for the condition. However, recommendations regarding screening for Barrett's esophagus may change periodically due to the most recent research, so it is best to consult with your doctor regarding the most recent recommendations.</p> <h3>Barrett's Esophagus and Cancer </h3> <p>One reason that doctors screen for Barrett's esophagus is that there is a chance, albeit small, for a person with Barrett's esophagus to develop a specific kind of cancer called esophageal adenocarcinoma. Each year, less than one percent of people with Barrett's esophagus develop this cancer. However, Barrett's esophagus may be present long before the cancer develops. Often, the cancer is not detected until its later stages when treatments are not as effective. People with Barrett's esophagus are usually recommended to periodically undergo endoscopies that include biopsies in order to check for the cancer's warning signs. It is important that multiple biopsies are taken in order to test thoroughly for cancerous or precancerous cells. Sometimes these cells can be missed in a single biopsy.</p> <p>Usually precancerous cells appear in Barrett's esophagus tissue prior to the onset of cancer. When these cells are present it is classified as a condition called dysplasia. This condition serves as a strong warning sign of the possibility for cancer in the future. Detecting and treating precancerous cells may prevent the actual cancer from developing. <br /></p> <h3>Treating Barrett's Esophagus with Dysplasia or Cancer</h3> <p>Generally Barrett's esophagus is not treated with surgery or procedures unless tests show a high chance of cancer development. This means that the dysplasia is severe or high-grade. </p> <p>Treatment options for Barrett's esophagus with dysplasia or cancer include:</p> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)</span> - While the patient is sedated, heat energy is applied to the Barrett's esophagus lining using a device that is inserted through the mouth </li> <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR)</span> - Uses processes that include suctioning, solution injection and cutting to remove the Barrett's esophagus lining through an endoscope.</li> <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Surgery</span> - Most of the esophagus is removed and the remainder of the esophagus is attached to a portion of the stomach that is pulled up into the chest.</li> </ul> <h3>Preventing Barrett's Esophagus</h3> <p>The diagnosis and treatment of GERD may prevent the onset of Barrett's esophagus. There are medications that your doctor may prescribe to treat GERD (see the NetWellness <a href="http://www.netwellness.org/healthtopics/x-gerd/gerdoverview.cfm">GERD Overview</a>). However, there are also some lifestyle changes that can be made to manage GERD, which could potentially prevent Barrett's esophagus:</p> <ul> <li>Lose weight if you are overweight</li> <li>Wait at least 3 hours before lying down after eating</li> <li>Do not eat large meals</li> <li>Put 6 inch blocks under the legs at the head of your bed</li> <li>Do not wear tight clothes around your belly</li> <li>Bend at your knees instead of bending over at the waist</li> <li>Do not smoke</li> </ul> <p>It is also important to avoid foods and liquids that relax the stomach muscle or stimulate acid. Caffeine, peppermint, spearmint, alcohol, citrus foods, juices, and foods high in fat are examples. </p> <p></p> <h3>For more information:</h3>Go to the <a href="/healthtopics/digestive/">Digestive Disorders</a> health topic, where you can: <ul> <li>Read articles on this topic</li> <li><a href="/experts/browsequestions.cfm?forumid=26">Browse</a> the previously asked questions</li> <li>Ask your own question.</li> </ul> <p><i>This article is a NetWellness exclusive.</i></p> <p><b><small>Last Reviewed: Jun 24, 2011</small></b></p> <p></p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td width="120"> <!-- Institutional/College logo --><a href="http://www.case.edu"><img src="/images/institutions/CWRU.png" border="0" alt="Case Western Reserve University" /></a></td> <!-- Name, Title etc --> <td valign="middle"><a href="/experts/biosketch.cfm?personid=900">Linda Cheng Cummings, MD, MS</a><br />Assistant Professor of Medicine<br /> <a href="http://www.cwrumedicine.org/faculty"> Division of Gastroenterology and Liver Disease </a> <br /> <a href="http://www.cwrumedicine.org/"> Department of Medicine </a> <br /> <a href="http://casemed.case.edu/"> School of Medicine </a> <br /> <a href="http://www.case.edu"> Case Western Reserve University </a> <br /> </td> <!-- Do they have a picture --> <td><a href="/experts/biosketch.cfm?personid=900"><img width="100" height="125" alt="Linda Cheng Cummings, MD, MS" src="http://www.netwellness.org/template/LindaCummings.jpg" border="0" /></a></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> </div> <!-- pagecontent --> <div id="navmenubottom"> <!-- General Menu Bar at the Bottom --> <table width="100%" border="1" background="/images/aboutmenugradient.jpg" summary="Bottom Navigation"> <form action="/search/listall.cfm" method="get"></form> <tbody> <tr align="center"> <td><a href="/default.cfm">Home</a></td> <td><a href="/aboutnw/">About</a></td> <td><a href="/healthtopics/help/helpfaq.cfm">Help</a></td> <td><a href="/feedback/">Feedback</a></td> <td><a href="/sitemap/default.cfm">Site Map</a></td> <td><img src="/images/magnifyingglass.gif" border="0" alt="Search NetWellness" width="18" height="17" /><a href="/search/">Search</a>&nbsp;<input name="searchstring" type="text" size="20" />&nbsp;<input type="image" src="/images/gobutton.gif" align="middle" border="0" alt="Search" />&nbsp;<font size="-2"><a href="/search/advancedsearch.cfm">Advanced</a> &nbsp;</font></td> <!-- AddThis Button BEGIN --> <td> <div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"> <a href="http://addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&amp;username=xa-4b4cc3d01a0171b3" class="addthis_button_compact">Share</a> <span class="addthis_separator">|</span> <a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a> <a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a> </div><script type="text/javascript" src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=xa-4b4cc3d01a0171b3"></script> <!-- AddThis Button END --></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id="footer"> <table cellpadding="5" summary="Bottom of Homepage section"> <tbody> <tr valign="top"> <td> <div id="feedback"> <form method="POST" action="/feedback/footerprocess.cfm" name="getinfo"> <table style="border:solid 1px #000000;" cellpadding="1" summary="Feedback Section"> <tbody> <tr> <td nowrap=""><b>This page is:</b></td> <th>Yes</th> <th>No</th> <th>Not<br />Sure</th> </tr> <tr> <td align="right">easy to read</td> <td><input type="Radio" name="onea" value="1" /></td> <td><input type="Radio" name="onea" value="2" /></td> <td><input type="Radio" name="onea" value="3" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right" nowrap="">easy to understand</td> <td><input type="Radio" name="oneb" value="1" /></td> <td><input type="Radio" name="oneb" value="2" /></td> <td><input type="Radio" name="oneb" value="3" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right">helpful</td> <td><input type="Radio" name="onec" value="1" /></td> <td><input type="Radio" name="onec" value="2" /></td> <td><input type="Radio" name="onec" value="3" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="4"><input type="submit" value="Submit" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <input type="hidden" name="referrer" value="www.netwellness.com/healthtopics/digestive/barrettsesophagus.cfm" /> </form> </div></td> <td> <!-- Disclaimer --><map name="institutions1"><area shape="rect" coords="420,1,528,50" href="http://medcenter.uc.edu/" alt="University of Cincinnati"></area><area shape="rect" coords="237,1,291,50" href="http://medicine.osu.edu/" alt="The Ohio State University"></area><area shape="rect" coords="1,1,86,50" href="http://mediswww.case.edu/" alt="Case Western Reserve University"></area></map> <center> <img src="/images/2011Footer.png" border="0" alt="NetWellness Institutions" usemap="#institutions1" /> </center><br /><b>Please note: only your personal physician or other health professional you consult can best advise you on matters of your health based on your medical history, your family medical history, your medication history, and how information from any of these databases may apply to you.

epilepsy has been the 'rediscovery' of the ketogenic diet. This diet is helping children whose seizures have resisted even the best of the modern anticonvulsant drugs.&quot; <br /> -C Dr. McIntyre Burnham, President, Epilepsy Ontario. <br /> <br />The ketogenic diet is a rigid, strictly calculated, therapeutic diet used in the treatment of difficult to control epilepsy in children. This diet is very high in fats and very low in protein and carbohydrates. <br /> <br />There are a few different ways to do a keto-diet, the first is a 'Standard Ketogenic Diet', or a SKD.� This is where you just restrict carbs, go into ketosis, and stay there for long periods until you've reached your fat loss goals, sometimes going back on carbs for a couple days or a week at a time.� Next is a 'Targeted Ketogenic Diet', or TKD.� A TKD is the same as an SKD, but you take in 25-50 grams of carbs about 30-60 minutes before weightlifting workouts to supply energy for the muscles (Note: These carbs will be burned during the workout, and should not be counted towards the 30g/day limit).� Last is a 'Cyclic Ketogenic Diet', a CKD, which is much more complex.� On a CKD, you go into ketosis during the week, and do 'carb-ups' on the weekends. <br />� <br /> <font color="000099">Who can use the Ketogenic Diet?</font> <br /> <br />The ketogenic diet is used to treat intractable epilepsy in children. It may be prescribed when seizures are out of control, and when the side effects of anticonvulsant drugs and/or surgery are considered unacceptable.� It may effectively treat some cases of childhood myoclonic, absence and atonic seizures as well as tonic clonic seizures, multi focal seizures, and Lennox Gastaut Syndrome.� It has also been used to treat structural brain disorders such as microcephaly, hypoxic brain damage, prior strokes, and developmental abnormalities. <br /> <br />The ketogenic diet is usually directed at children one to eight years of age. Children below the age of one are not usually put on the diet as they may experience side effects, such as hypoglycemia. The diet has had some success with select older children and adolescents too. It is prescribed only when both the child and the family are highly motivated. The diet may be prescribed for two to three years. <br /> <br />It is said that adults may have problems maintaining essential nutrients, and therefore may not benefit from the diet, but in depth studies are rare and inconclusive. Many adults would not want to follow such a diet C most adults find it unpalatable C and find it very difficult to stick to it. <br />� <br /> <font color="000099">How does the Diet Work?</font> <br /> <br />To start the diet, children are admitted into the hospital, where they fast for two to three days. They receive only water, diet Kool-Aid, or diet Jell-O until tests for urine ketones are strongly positive, usually within 24 hours.� By doing this, all of the glucose (sugar) in the blood will be used up for energy. The ketogenic diet works by tricking the body into reacting as if it is starving or fasting: it causes the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates. When fats are burned in the absence of sugars, they do not burn completely. Instead, a residue of ketone bodies remains: the body is in a state of ketosis.� After the fasting period, children are started on a one-third fat shake then gradually introduced to the full diet. During the hospital stay, blood glucose levels and urinary ketone levels are monitored daily.� Parents are instructed in diet preparation and informed how to handle illness in children on the diet. They are also taught to read product labels to determine the carbohydrate content of various foods.� At discharge, parents receive information on how to handle children on the ketogenic diet in the classroom. <br /> <br />Despite the use of this diet in the treatment of seizure disorder since the 1920s and before, its exact mechanism is unknown. Research was largely discontinued when newer anti epileptic drugs became available in the 1940s. <br />� <br /> <font color="000099">Safety &amp; Side Effects</font> <br /> <br />The ketogenic diet is both safe and effective, with rare side effects only when it is not strictly followed. There is documentation of dehydration, constipation and a rare account of kidney stone formation, lowered immune functions, low blood sugar, and implication of increased serum lipid profile, which requires close monitoring. During the initial fast, your child's blood sugar level should be checked every four to six hours. The level often falls, which may lead to hypoglycemia. <br /> <br /> <b>The ketogenic diet must be supervised by qualified specialists.</b> <br />� <br /> <font color="000099">Is the Diet Nutritionally Complete?</font> <br /> <br />Dietary supplements, such as multivitamins and calcium, must be taken. These must be given in sugar free form. <br />� <br /> <font color="000099">Living with the Diet</font> <br /> <br />After consultation, if you opt for the diet, you may be asked to participate in a trial period. Also, there may be several days of training time when you will be given a diet designed specifically for your child. Everything your child consumes must be weighed and accounted for in the diet. The child may feel hungry during the first week or two. However, ketosis decreases the appetite. Some children on the ketogenic diet will feel very thirsty. Some parents give their children a regular dose of water or caffeine free diet soda every one or two hours during the day. Always consult your child's pediatrician or neurologist about the specifics of the ketogenic diet in your case. <br />� <br /> <font color="000099">Success</font> <br /> <br />�When rigidly adhered to, the ketogenic diet may successfully control epilepsy in 30-50% of children with intractable seizures. Many others will experience a marked decrease in seizure frequency. A child on the diet usually continues taking anti-epileptic medicine, but may be able to take less of it later on.� Many will be able to return to a normal diet within two to three years, free of seizures or medication. Most people investigate this diet as a last resort. The diet can be unpalatable and demands a great commitment from the entire family for a considerable period of time. Most people who make it past the first month will stick with the diet until they can return to a normal diet. <br />� <br /> <b>Sample Meal Plan:</b> <br /> <b>Breakfast:</b> <ul> <ul> <li>Scrambled eggs with butter </li> <li>Diluted cream </li> <li>Orange juice </li> </ul> </ul> <b><br />Lunch:</b> <ul> <ul> <li>Spaghetti squash with butter and Parmesan cheese </li> <li>Lettuce leaf with mayonnaise </li> <li>Orange diet soda mixed with whipped cream </li> </ul> </ul> <b><br />Dinner:</b> <ul> <ul> <li>Hot dog slices with sugar-free catsup </li> <li>Asparagus with butter </li> <li>Chopped lettuce with mayonnaise </li> <li>Sugar-free vanilla cream popsicle </li> </ul> </ul> <b><br />These examples do not show the exact amounts for each food because those have to be worked out for each child by the dietician.</b> <br />� <br /> <font color="000099">Where is the Diet Administered?</font> <br /> <br />In Ontario, the ketogenic diet is administered at the larger children's hospitals and several clinics.� Some hospitals and clinics are now considering the implementation of the ketogenic diet for adults. <br />The following centres (neurology departments) in Canada are able to start children on the diet: IWK Hospital for Children, Halifax, NS; Hospital Sainte -Justine, Montreal, QC; Montreal Children's Hospital, Montreal, QC; Bloorview-MacMillan Centre, No. York, Toronto, ON; Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, ON; BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC. <br /> <b>Parents and others are warned against trying to institute any part of the diet on their own.� The ketogenic diet is a complex medical treatment therapy that requires close supervision by a physician.</b> <br />� <br /> <font color="000099">Medium-Chain Triglyceride (MCT) Diet</font> <br /> <br />An alternative to the &quot;classic&quot; ketogenic diet is the MCT (medium-chain triglyceride) diet, which involves the use of a special oil to attain ketosis.� Although this diet is less unsettling and more flexible than the ketogenic diet, it is generally not as effective and less well tolerated. <br />� <br />� </div></td> <td align="right" valign="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="100%" rowspan="2" style="padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px"><a href="/client/eo/eoweb.nsf/PrinterFriendly/Ketogenic+Diet+(alt.+&amp;+comp.+therapies)?OpenDocument"><img src="/client/EO/EOObjects.nsf/object/Icons/$file/PrintBox.gif" border="0" alt="Printer Friendly" vspace="1" /></a><a href="https://www.epilepsyontario.org/client/EO/webmail.nsf/Direct+Donation"><img src="/client/EO/EOObjects.nsf/object/Nav/$file/Donate.gif" border="0" alt="We could really use your donation" vspace="1" /></a></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="bottom" class="Body" align="center"><br /><br /><a href="#ptop"><img src="/client/EO/EOObjects.nsf/object/Nav/$file/top.gif" border="0" /></a><br /><br /> <hr width="80%" color="lightgrey" noshade="" /><br /> <div> To submit questions, comments, or suggestions please click <a href="/client/EO/webmail.nsf/Comment?OpenForm">here</a>. <br /> <br /> <font color="lightgrey">Last Modified: 08/19/2010 11:48:31 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /></font> </div></td> </tr> </tbody> </table><br /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table></a> </div> <script type="text/javascript">var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?

Increasing your magnesium intake by adding new foods to your diet is a great way to stay healthy.</p> <h2>What Does Magnesium Do?</h2> <p>Magnesium is a very important nutrient when it comes to keeping yourself in optimal health. It's the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and has many important functions, such as maintaining bone health, heart rate, blood clotting, protein formation and producing insulin. It also helps to relax muscles, and often people who experience leg cramps find that a calcium and magnesium supplement helps to ease the problem.</p> <p>Besides aiding in the absorption of nutrients such as <a href="/Foods_High_in_Calcium" title="Foods High in Calcium">calcium</a> and vitamin B, magnesium can also help to prevent cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, osteoporosis, diabetes, depression, asthma and arthritis. Approximately half of your body's magnesium is found in your bones, while the rest if distributed throughout the rest of your tissue and organs.</p> <script type="text/javascript">var google_ad_channel='1035493004';var google_ad_client='pub-3619764495662405';var google_ad_output='js';var google_ad_type='text';var google_image_size='468x60';var google_max_num_ads='3';</script> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script> <h2>Getting More Magnesium</h2> <p>The human body can't store large amounts of magnesium and what you do not use is generally excreted through your urinary and digestive systems. This means that you need to keep up a regular intake of magnesium to make sure that your body has it ready for when it needs it - which is all the time!</p> <p>There are two ways you can get more magnesium: by taking dietary supplements and by eating more magnesium rich foods. While it's easier to take a few pills every day to help increase your intake, it is a lot healthier to get magnesium through your diet since foods usually contain a series of vitamins that work synergistically, meaning that they work together to help your body assimilate nutrients into your system.</p> <p>If you vary the foods you eat to include some of those listed below, you shouldn't need to take an additional supplement.</p> <h3>A List of Magnesium Rich Foods</h3> <p>Some really popular foods are already high in magnesium, so you might be getting a good amount already. If you're interested in consuming more, here's a list of foods that will help you increase your intake of this vital nutrient.</p> <div class="image right" style="width: 227px"> <a href="/image/119879~Tuna_sandwich.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://cf.ltkcdn.net/vitamins/images/std/119879-225x338-Tuna_sandwich.jpg" /></a> Enjoy a magnesium-rich tuna sandwich. </div> <ul> <li>Avocados</li> <li><a href="/What_Vitamins_and_Minerals_Are_in_Bananas" title="What Vitamins and Minerals Are in Bananas">Bananas</a></li> <li>Black beans</li> <li>Cashews</li> <li>Enriched cereals and grains</li> <li>Halibut</li> <li>Lentils</li> <li>Yogurt</li> <li>Okra</li> <li>Oysters</li> <li>Peanuts</li> <li>Potatoes</li> <li>Pumpkin seeds</li> <li>Raisins</li> <li>Spinach</li> <li>Scallops</li> <li>Soy Milk</li> <li>Tofu</li> <li>Tuna</li> </ul> <h2>How Much Magnesium Do You Need?</h2> <p>Your magnesium requirements can change depending on your age, gender and what's going on in your life. On the average, it is recommended that adult women get about 310 milligrams of magnesium a day, while adult men need a little more (about 410 milligrams). If you are a pregnant woman, you should be getting about 360 milligrams a day to accommodate the needs of you and your baby.</p> <h3>Can You Get Too Much?</h3> <p>While you can't really overdose on dietary magnesium, you can indeed take too much supplemental magnesium. This means that if you take magnesium pills, you should not take more than the daily recommended amount. A supplemental magnesium overdose can result in abdominal cramping, and over time, kidney failure.</p> <h2>More Information on Magnesium</h2> <p>If you're looking for more information about increasing your magnesium intake, here are some links that will help you learn more.</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/magnesium.asp" rel="nofollow">The National Institute of Health</a> has a great page on magnesium that outlines everything you need to know.</li> <li><a href="http://www.diet.com/g/magnesium" rel="nofollow">Diet.com</a> talks about how much magnesium is a healthy amount and how much it varies by age, stage of life, etc.</li> <li><a href="http://www.enotalone.com/article/9586.html" rel="nofollow">This is an interesting article about the importance of magnesium</a> and how it can help to resolve lingering health problems.</li> </ul> <div id="more"> <h2>Related Topics</h2> <div id="slideshow"> <div class="image feature"> <a title="" rel="slideshow" href="/Vitamin_K_Foods"><img src="http://cf.ltkcdn.net/vitamins/images/feat-lg/124230-280x190r1-openvitk.jpg" alt="" /> <div class="overlay"></div></a> <div class="caption"> <a rel="slideshow" href="/Vitamin_K_Foods">Vitamin K Foods</a> </div> </div> </div> <ul id="related"> <li><a title="Food Sources for Magnesium" href="/Foods_High_in_Magnesium">Foods High in Magnesium</a></li> <li><a title="Leaves of Spinach" href="/Magnesium_Facts">Magnesium Facts</a></li> <li><a title="calcium foods and supplements" href="/List_of_Calcium_Rich_Foods">List of Calcium Rich Foods</a></li> <li><a title="Periodic Table Sodium and Magnesium" href="/What_is_Magnesium_Used_For">What Is Magnesium Used For?</a></li> <li><a href="/Who_Discovered_Magnesium">Who Discovered Magnesium</a></li> <li><a href="/Category:Vitamins_in_Food">Vitamins in Food</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.lovetoknow.com/health.html">Health &amp;

I guess you can tell I love morel mushrooms! <!--INFOLINKS_ON--><br clear="all" /><br clear="all" /><br />Whether they are the small grayish variety, or the larger creamy yellow ones, the morel is something special. I've spent countless hours and hiked many miles looking for the fantastic fungus, and I've never found enough. Even when coming home with a large bagful, I always wish I'd found more.<br /><br />Now just so you know, I've never smoked morels, and haven't grilled any morels either. But I do think a person could set a little cast iron skillet over a grill burner and fry up some morels in bacon grease with no problem. You might even toss in a foil packet of wood chips to give the fried morels a hint of smoky flavor. But that's not what this page is about. It's about memories and my most recent mushroom hunt…<br /><br /><br /></p><h2>Hunting Morels</h2>It rained cats and dogs all day yesterday, finally letting up about 8 AM this morning. I figured it would be a good time to check out my favorite spots, so I headed into the woods here at the home place in Northeast Kansas. I know these woods well, having traipsed through the hilly oak, ash, elm and walnut woodlands from the age of around 10 to present… over 40 years. <p></p><p>Many of the trees stand out in my memory, like the group of tall red oaks, that I christened, in my mind at least, Valley of the Giants. The oaks are on the lower part of a hillside that drops down to Dead Dog Creek, another name of my doing. And just over the fence at the very back of the half-mile deep property is a smallish hickory tree that has a unique twist. It's about 6 inches in diameter, and grows straight up for about 2 feet. It makes a 90 degree turn, growing horizontally for another couple of feet. And then, it rises straight up again. It makes a dandy little natural chair that comes in handy when needed. The tree might be a shagbark hickory, but for me, it's a little too young to tell. Weird thing is, that the horizontal section points straight North. Coincidence? Or did someone bend it on purpose years ago as a marker? I'll never know for sure.</p><p>Anyway, more about this morning's attempt at finding morels…</p><p>Walking into the woods, I looked for trees where I thought morel mushrooms might be growing, wading through the patches of buckbrush and whatever else was just starting to grow again after the winter cold. Heading east to the barn, where one morel was found last week, there was nothing. Then turning south, I walked past several old haunts that usually held a few choice morels. </p><p>Not too far into the woods from the pasture, there used to be a big old dead elm tree, and you could count on almost always finding some morels there. But now, all that's left of the tree is a small, barely perceptable pile of rotted humus. And there were no mushrooms to be found. But I did see this box turtle. Kind of odd, the way its color is sort of like the color of yellow morels. Got a little excited there for a second…</p><p><img src="http://www.smoker-cooking.com/images/boxturtle1.jpg" width="400" alt="finding morels" border="0" /><br clear="all" /><br /><br />Heading farther south, I passed some oak and ash trees where I remember finding a few big yellow morels one time, about 20 years ago, but not today. Dang!</p><p><img src="http://www.smoker-cooking.com/images/oakash.jpg" width="400" alt="hunting morels" border="0" /><br clear="all" /><br /><br />One of the nice things about hunting morel mushrooms is you never know what you'll see along the way. Even though the woods were a little sparse, the redbud trees were in full bloom. Pretty, huh?</p><p><img src="http://www.smoker-cooking.com/images/redbud9.jpg" width="400" alt="morel mushrooms" border="0" /><br clear="all" /><br /><br />A little farther on, I arrived at the old spring. My grandpa took a lot of time making improvements there, digging into the hillside and placing a section of culvert in place so the water flowed out easily, falling into a muddy, leaf lined pool. Just below the spring there used to be another dead elm mushroom-tree. But it's also long gone, and sadly, there were no mushrooms there today. This is a picture of the spring water as it flows the rest of the way down the hill.</p><p><img src="http://www.smoker-cooking.com/images/creek9.jpg" width="400" alt="mushroom tree" border="0" /><br clear="all" /><br /><br /></p><p>When I made it down to the bottom of the hill, my eyes found another interesting object… a pile of turkey poop. It may not interest you, but turkeys have only been in these parts for the last 10 years or so, so finding one of their roosting trees is always kind of cool. I made the image on the page small just to be less disgusting (that is, if you find turkey poop disgusting). If you want to see it up close and personal, just click on the pic.</p><p><a href="http://www.smoker-cooking.com/images/t-poop.jpg" width="700" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true" onmouseover="window.status=''; return true" target="_new" border="0"><img src="http://www.smoker-cooking.com/images/t-poops.jpg" width="225" border="0" align="left" alt="Morel Mushrooms and Turkey Poop" hspace="5" /></a><br clear="all" /><br /><br /></p><h2>Morel Mushrooms in the Buckbrush</h2>Past the poop, I made it to the large redbud tree with the gnarly burls on its trunk. And hidden in the patch of buckbrush near its base, I found a few morels! Alright, success at last! I was too excited to snap a pic of the morels before I picked them, but did manage to get a picture of the burls on the redbud tree.<p></p><p><img src="http://www.smoker-cooking.com/images/r-budburl.jpg" width="400" alt="gray morels in buckbrush" border="0" /><br clear="all" /><br /><br /></p><p>I figured it was time to turn around and head back up the hill towards home. At the base of another tree, a walnut I think, there was a humongous ant hill, with little ant crawling around every which way. The base of the tree was about a foot in diameter, for perspective's sake.</p><p><img src="http://www.smoker-cooking.com/images/anthill.jpg" width="400" alt="mushroom tree" border="0" /><br clear="all" /><br /><br /></p><p>When I made it back the house, I had my prize in hand. The <i>morel mushrooms</i> were all still pretty fresh, clean, and looking more tempting by the moment. I split them lengthwise, soaked them in salt water for a while to kill the bugs and float them off, and then dried them. A little egg wash, a coating of flour, and a hot pan of bacon grease took care of the rest. </p><p><img src="http://www.smoker-cooking.com/images/morel-mushrooms.jpg" width="400" alt="Finding Morel Mushrooms" border="0" /><br clear="all" /><br /><br /></p><p>I just about had to smoke a cigarette when I finished eating them…</p><p><br /><br /></p><h3>About Hunting Morel Mushrooms</h3>Even though I found only a few morel mushrooms, and got totally excited eating them, the greatest pleasure was in walking through the spring woods, seeing all the things that will soon be hidden by the leaves and thick underbrush. Glad I get a chance to do it once or twice a year. And if you tried hunting for morels before, it's something I highly recommend you try.
