Amber has since published <a href="http://www.beingamberrhea.com/2009/04/27/geocities-and-snippets-of-personal-internet-history/">a post</a>.</p> <p>I’m going for an executive summary here and will probably miss a few important items, but if I try to be a perfectionist about this I’ll never end up writing anything. I am also including some pre-Internet backstory that I think is also important to take down. Read more after the jump.</p> <p><span id="more-616"></span></p> <p><strong>Pre-Internet</strong></p> <p>I’m part of the first generation of kids who doesn’t know what it’s like not to have cable television. While it wasn’t as common for houses to have a computer during this time, I have never known a time where I wasn’t using one.</p> <p>My dad built his own PCs from kits before they were even sold in stores, and my earliest memory of using a computer is playing a <em>Ghostbusters</em> game on the Commodore 64. I had my own plastic box of large floppy disks for the C64, which I remember was very exciting to me at the time.</p> <p>I also played Oregon Trail in (I think) my third or fourth grade glass. The school had not purchased enough computers for every classroom to have one, so the few computers they had rotated from room-to-room. Every kid got an allotment of time they could use the computer.</p> <p>In middle school, I submitted a paper typed and printed from Word for Windows and the teacher accused me of having my parents write the paper for me. My mom had to convince her otherwise.</p> <p><strong>Early days</strong></p> <p>Before the World Wide Web, there were bulletin board services like Compuserve and Prodigy. We never had these in our house, but I had a friend who had Prodigy. Naturally, in middle school we downloaded the Anarchist’s Cookbook and never did anything with it, but it seemed like an act of rebellion of some sort at the time.</p> <p>I didn’t have my own computer until college, but started sending emails and using message boards and chat rooms around my junior or senior year of high school.</p> <p><strong>Freshman year of college (late 1997-early 1998)</strong></p> <p>My dad built a computer for me, a gigantic beige tower with a sluggish (even then) 75 mhz Pentium processor and Windows 95 on it along with a crappy CRT monitor to take with me to the University of Tennessee. Not long after arriving in school, he sent me a Windows 98 beta that I installed on there.</p> <p>During this time I went from someone who was slightly ahead of the curve compared to average to being an Internet junkie. It was the year in my history that was more influential on my current computing habits than any other.</p> <p>UT still had people log into their email and perform other tasks using a Unix terminal over Telnet, which turned out to be a blessing for me because it helped me conceptualize a lot of what was going on behind the scenes. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I started thinking of computing in platform-agnostic terms.</p> <p>The university also provided free web hosting space to all students. I went through six or seven web pages that year, mostly creating pages with links to .wav files from movies I liked and lots of animated GIFs. This was also done over Telnet, hand-crafting my HTML pages with Pico. I also had accounts on Geocities and Tripod in their heyday and dabbled with hosting pages on those services.</p> <p>My suitemate next door would alternately blare out Tupac and Metallica at ear-splitting volumes at all hours of the day and night. I learned how to use graphics software (Paint Shop Pro and the Microsoft Animated GIF tool, if I recall correctly) so I could harass him by emailing lewd doctored images of Tupac every day.</p> <p>I was still really into cars at the time, and was a Chevy partisan. I still drive the Chevy truck my parents bought me as a sort of high school graduation present, though it’s starting to wheeze a little after 12 years. I sat around and drew sketches of trucks, oblivious enough of what a dork this made me that my roommate freshman year had an intervention and asked me to stop doing that because “he wanted me to actually get laid.”</p> <p>I mention this because I also spent a lot of time that year getting into pointless arguments with people who knew a lot more about cars than I did on a Ford vs. Chevy message board.</p> <p>In another demonstration of sound judgment, I almost got kicked off the network entirely at one point for bulk e-mailing several hundred students at random after a football game. I don’t remember what I was complaining about, but it rightfully pissed a lot of people off that I did this.</p> <p>Our dorm room was networked together, and we played lots of Quake, Terminator and Grand Theft Auto multiplayer games. We also shared files, including thousands of MP3s. If you stood around our dorm in the afternoon, you wouldn’t have to wait long to hear the “Winamp: it really kicks the llama’s ass” sound coming from one room or another.</p> <p>I’d imagine I did some school work at some point. ICQ was all the rage with the kids.</p> <p>And of course, there was porn. Wow, did I ever look at a lot of porn that year.</p> <p><strong>Working for my mom’s company on breaks during college</strong></p> <p>Another formative set of experiences in my early days on the Internet was when my mom hired me on a couple of occasions to help put together a new web site and marketing materials for her company.</p> <p>It worked out well both ways, because she paid me less than half of what she would have paid an agency, which was still a lot of money to me at the time. I got to learn how to do a lot of things on the job as I needed to do them. And if I do say so myself, the work turned out pretty darn decent given my experience level.</p> <p>Alas, the company and the web site no longer exist, though I have a back-up copy of the site on my hard drive.</p> <p><strong>Internship with Kinetic Design</strong></p> <p>The timeline in college is a little hazy for me now which is why I’m grouping these by experience rather than by exact year. After either my freshman or sophomore year of college I landed an internship with a small web development firm called Kinetic Design (now doing business as <a href="http://www.cooldoginteractive.com/">Cool Dog Interactive</a>). They happened to share space with an advertising agency I interviewed for an internship with, and the ad agency took one look at my resum&eacute; and thought I’d be better off next door.</p> <p>Of course, Kinetic Design wasn’t terribly impressed with my resum&eacute; either, so it’s a wonder I got that gig at all. I’m assuming they were desperate to hire someone. I ended up doing okay there, even though I don’t think they were ever totally comfortable with me or vice versa.</p> <p>I got my first experience working on big corporate accounts here, and also had my first experience with doing all my work on a Mac. They had those green G3 towers that were cutting edge at the time. They were nice people and I hope they’re doing well, even if we weren’t the best fit at the time.</p> <p><strong>The rest of college (1998-2002)</strong></p> <p>During the remaining years of school, I continued to dabble and tinker with a lot of things.</p> <p>I mentioned ICQ earlier. In what seems sort of an odd phenomenon now, I and other people I knew would sit around and message people at random, not knowing their geography or much else about them. I even took a trip to North Carolina to meet one girl I had talked to on ICQ. I was nervous, and it turned out as awkwardly as stereotypes tell you a meeting like that should turn out.</p> <p>Over a Christmas break, I built a better computer and started to get into the hardware side more. My roommate one year had a job doing IT at a hospital, and had access to all sorts of computer parts. I built a file server out of an array of old cheap hard drives, my Pentium 75, and a pirated copy of Windows 2000 Server edition.</p> <p>I worked in the UT computer lab for several years, learning a little here and there when trying to answer people’s questions, but mostly using the time to do school work or play Dope Wars.</p> <p>My last couple of years, I got an actual job as webmaster of <a href="http://www.rockytopbooks.com">Rocky Top Books</a>, an off-campus book store. The parent company Nebraska Books had store software, and someone was needed to do some basic skinning and to upload product photos.</p> <p>The photos I took and uploaded were called out at a corporate meeting as examples of how to do them the right way, which secretly made me a little proud even though we all made a big show of talking about how much we hated the parent company. Little or none of the work I did is reflected on the current web site, but when I was in Knoxville last year I saw the delivery truck still has the decals I designed on it.</p> <p>I also worked briefly for an ill-fated concert promotion company along with Furious D. I designed a couple of web sites, got drunk with some sketchy people, and got into some free concerts. There were two things I actually learned that were useful to me though, both having to do with clients we tried to get but didn’t land.</p> <p>The first was when the manager of a famous recording artist called us about an estimate for web site development. I was busy with school work and took too long to get back to them, and by then they weren’t interested. So lesson one was a very basic principle of customer service that was later reiterated during my stint at Best Buy: even if you can’t help someone right away, acknowledge them and tell them you’ll help them soon.</p> <p>The second was when the president of the company (one of the aforementioned sketchy characters) was pitching web development services to a band, and then without warning gave the floor up to me. We had vague ideas about what we wanted to sell — web sites, promotional video packages, and probably some other web-related services to go along with traditional concert promotion. What we didn’t have were package deals and price lists set up. So I learned that just telling someone “we can do anything you want us to do” doesn’t fly. They were coming to me because they have no clue what they want, so it’s my job to tell them and to let them argue with me if they think I’m wrong.</p> <p><strong>2003</strong></p> <p>This was somewhat of a down period online for me. I had a job as a newspaper writer, and most of my time spent online was reading news, researching stories, and emailing people.</p> <p>I met Jen at a Howard Dean meet-up I was covering for the newspaper. This was one of my first experiences being around online activism. Truthfully, the meet-up itself wasn’t very impressive. It was two hours of people sitting around talking about how great Howard Dean was and maybe fifteen minutes of actual productive work (writing letters to people).</p> <p>Jen and I went and played Trivial Pursuit at some Dean kids’ apartment after, which probably wasn’t the best idea in retrospect.</p> <p><strong>Late 2003</strong></p> <p>I quit my newspaper job around October of that year (that’s a whole other story for another time), and was drifting, trying to plot my next career move after a couple of interviews I’d lined up didn’t work out. I had a background in web development, a degree in English and journalism, and some work experience in both, and wasn’t sure at the time that I really wanted to do either one. The first few months at the newspaper was some of the most fun I’ve had at a job, followed by the worst experience I’ve ever had with an employer during the last few months.</p> <p>I was content to bide my time while I plotted, so I looked for temp work doing mindless office tasks. I also immersed myself in a couple of web sites: <a href="http://zoetrope.com">Zoetrope</a> and <a href="http://newgrounds.com">Newgrounds</a>.</p> <p>In college, I had a lot of fun in a fiction writing class where we peer reviewed each other’s stories. Zoetrope was a site for writers to post their work and review other people’s work. It was ahead of its time, and had a neat system that forced you to review five other stories before you were allowed to post your own work. It was interesting to get some honest criticism of some pieces I had written years before, and to randomly stumble on work from people at different stages in their craft (some rank amateurs, some who could have been published in literary journals, and many in-between).</p> <p>Newgrounds was one of the first experiences I had that I would think of as homegrown media, even though several before it probably qualified. It’s a site that hosts user-posted Flash cartoons and allows people to rate them. It was way ahead of its time in that it had a rating system like you see on Digg now that actually worked pretty well. Much of what was on there was terrible, but it was gratifying to stumble on something creative that not many other people had seen. I never got around to posting my own cartoons there, but I rated and reviewed hundreds.</p> <p>Then I decided to start a blog.</p> <p><strong>Yaarr, tis me blog!</strong></p> <p>I still have <a href="http://yaarchives.rustytanton.com/">an archive</a> of this up. The thing that strikes me about the writing is how angsty and juvenile it reads now, even though it wasn’t really all that long ago. I cringe when I read it the way I do when I read comments in my high school yearbooks. But I’m also glad there’s a record of my thoughts at the time.</p> <p>I started it in December 2003, hosting it on Earthlink webspace using Blogger at first, and moving it to my own domain using WordPress not long after. I still had an itch to follow and write about news and politics that the newspaper somehow had managed not to stifle, but also wanted to mix in personal stories, tech stuff and sports here and there. I didn’t want to write for a living at the time, so I created a theme with the idea that no one would take it seriously. My annual NCAA Picks contest goes all the way back to that blog.</p> <p>There probably weren’t more than a dozen Atlanta-based blogs at that point, at least that I knew of. Some of the people who were writing at the time are still my good friends now; others I’ve lost contact with.</p> <p>We were all pretty crushed by the 2004 election. I wasn’t a partisan Democrat, but it didn’t take a partisan to recognize that George W. Bush was a train wreck of a president.</p> <p>This led to a failed attempt to put together a political action committee among a group of bloggers and some friends. It was a great experience because so many things went so wrong so quickly that we got a lot of education out of it without it costing us much more than a little time.</p> <p>At the same time as we were failing at creating a PAC, I grew disillusioned with that blog and started another one.</p> <p><strong>Radical Georgia Moderate</strong></p> <p>My original idea was to write a blog focused entirely on Georgia politics, mixing Cobb County politics with state politics. It didn’t take me long to want to occasionally divert my attention from that however, and from a content standpoint it eventually wasn’t a whole lot different from my first blog: politics, with occasional sports and personal stories and tech notes thrown in when I got bored with politics.</p> <p>It was marginally less angsty than the first blog, though in the first couple of years I didn’t filter much at all. Several lame blog dramas played out in front of an audience; tantrums and rants were not uncommon; tempers flared; egos were bruised; enemies were made. My blogging to that point had been rooted in a lot of negativity.</p> <p>And while it’s not how I choose to interact with people or view the world now, I don’t regret and wouldn’t apologize for writing a word of it.</p> <p>Despite all that negativity, much awesomeness came from that blog. I met more friends, one of whom (<a href="http://joeventures.com">Joeventures</a>) found me some interesting part-time work that helped me eventually dig myself out of the professional rut I was in. And of course, I met Amber after we started commenting on each other’s blogs. The job I have now, which is in most ways the best job I’ve ever had, can also be traced back to that blog.</p> <p>I eventually shuttered it because I got to a place in my life where I didn’t want to dwell in negativity. Politics (and media for that matter) can be a grimy, scum-ridden place that makes me sad and angry when I spend too much time thinking about it. So I don’t, beyond continuing to read just enough that I’m not uninformed when I vote.</p> <p>One other good experience that came from that was Amber and I started…</p> <p><strong>The Georgia Podcast Network</strong></p> <p>We started the podcast site right at the peak of the hype surrounding podcasting. The funny thing about podcasting is it’s never stopped growing and is more popular than ever, but the hype machine has moved on to other things.</p> <p>I continue to enjoy maintaining the site and posting there because it gives me a more positive outlet than the other sites I’d made before gave me. Having to look someone in the eye when you speak with them (as we do for almost all our interviews on <a href="http://www.gapodcastnetwork.com/network-programs/mostly-itp">Mostly ITP</a>) causes both interviewer and interviewee to take a more civil, thoughtful tone I think.</p> <p>The momentum we had from the launch of this site in 2006 helped Amber put together the first <a href="http://podcampatlanta.com/">PodCamp Atlanta</a>, which was only the second event of its kind in Atlanta (the first SoCon happened just a few weeks prior). Now barely a month passes in this town without a similar event happening, and I think Amber deserves some credit for being on the forefront of that.</p> <p>Still, for a while, I was a little disappointed in the back of my mind that the site hasn’t picked up more steam than it has. Sure, we’ve gotten a couple of Best of Atlanta awards, and I’m not saying that isn’t nice. But I guess it seemed to me that it could have been more than it is. Our traffic is only a little higher now than it was a year or so ago, so it’s not growing at a breakneck speed. Barely anyone leaves comments. We get new podcasts on there, but others seem to stop posting at about the same pace.</p> <p>Ultimately, it’s totally been worth it to have a pretense to speak with people that are interesting to me.</p> <p><strong>This place and Web Two-Point-Oh</strong></p> <p>I don’t seem to have as much energy for blogging these days, the occasional long ranty post that seems to come out of nowhere notwithstanding.</p> <p>Some of that can probably be attributed to all the Web 2.0 whizbangs that take up my time. I have a list of many of them in sidebar.</p> <p>Part of it is that I’m in a happier place now than I’ve ever been really, and it’s harder for me to maintain the energy to write something reflective every day if I’m not pissed off.</p> <p>A lot of the daily commenting chatter that had been happening on my blog and the blogs I read and commented on regularly has moved to Facebook and Twitter. I sort of like that I have to confine my negative thoughts to 140 characters now.</p> <p>And of course, having adult responsibilities like a job and a lawn to mow get in the way of blogging.</p> <p>But none of that should be read to mean that I’m any less enthusiastic about the concept of putting yourself out there online. The big thing I take from reading back on all this is that none of it was a waste of time, despite some people’s scoffs and “friendly” advice. On the whole I’ve taken out as much as I’ve put into it, and probably more.</p> <p class="postmetadata alt"> This entry was posted on Tuesday, April 28th, 2009 at 11:42 am.

Russell</h3> <p>Originally published in: <b>Solar Wind, NASA sp-308</b>, 365-374, 1972</p> <h3> <p> </p></h3> </center> ABSTRACTExamination of the possible sources of noise in the Measurement of the power spectrum of fluctuations in the interplanetary magnetic field shows that mostmeasurements by flux gate magnetometers are limited by digitization noise whereas thesearch coil magnetometer is limited by instrument noise. The folding of power about theNyquist frequency or aliasing can be a serious problem at times for many magnetometers,but it is not serious during typical solar wind conditions except near the Nyquistfrequency. Waves in the solar wind associated with the presence of the earth's bow shockcan contaminate the interplanetary spectrum in the vicinity of the earth. However, attimes the spectrum in this region is the same as far from the earth. Doppler shiftingcaused by the convection of waves by the solar wind makes the interpretation ofinterplanetary spectra exceedingly difficult. <p></p> <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>The interplanetary magnetic field has been probed bymany spacecraft, and it has been popular to calculate thepower spectrum of the fluctuations in the interplanetarymagnetic field with the hope of gaining some insight intothe physical processes occurring in the solar wind. Powerspectra have been obtained from Pioneer 5 [ <i>Coleman,</i>1964]. Mariner 2 [ <i>Coleman</i>, 1966], OGO-1 [ <i>Holzer etal</i>., 1966], Mariner 4 [ <i>Siscoe et al</i>, 1968], Pioneer 6[ <i>Sari and Ness</i>, 1969], Mariner 5 [ <i>Belcher and Davis</i>,1971] and OGO-5 [ <i>Childers et al</i>., 1971]. Although thecalculation of power spectra is quite straightforwardanalytically, there are many technical difficultiesinvolved in determining the power spectrum of solarwind fluctuations. They stem mainly from the fact thatthe magnetic field and its fluctuations are quite small.Thus, it is possible that noise sources inherent in themeasurement process could significantly add to themeasured power spectrum. In addition, since manyinstruments have much wider pass bands than thebandwidth of the power spectrum being measured, noisefrom outside the nominal frequency band of thespectrum may be folded into the spectrum. This effect,called <i>aliasing</i>, in some cascs can alter the spectrumsignificantly. Further, a spectrum measured in the solarwind may not be truly representative of the interplanetary medium if it is measured near the earth, sincewaves, apparently radiated from the earth's bow shock,are present for large distances (up to 46 R <img src="sub.E.gif" align="middle" />) from theshock in the solar wind [ <i>Fairfield</i>, 1969; <i>Russell et al</i>.,1971] . Here we examine the extent that these problemshave affected measured interplanetary spectra, and inthis light construct a meaningful typical interplanetaryspectrum. Finally, we shall make some comments on theinterpretation of interplanetary power spectra, mainly asa guide to the uninitiated. <p></p> <h3>INSTRUMENT NOISE LEVELS</h3>Since the interplanetary field is so small, approximately10 <img src="tiny-4.gif" align="top" /> of that at the surface of the earth, one of the firstquestions that might be asked is whether the inherentnoise levels of the magnetometers are comparable to thenoise being measured. In particular, we would like tocompare the spectrum of the instrument noise with themeasured interplanetary spectrum. Unfortunately. veryfew magnetometer experimenters have made this comparison.Usually, at best, an rms amplitude noise oversome bandwidth is quoted with no clue as to thedistribution of the noise over this band. <a href="fig.1.gif">Figure 1</a> showsinstrument noise levels for the OCO-3 search coilmagnetometer [ <i>Russell et al</i>., 1970] and for twofluxgate magnetometers, which were backup units fortwo different deep space missions. Also on this figure isa curve representing a typical quiet spectrum of onecomponent of the interplanetary field in this frequencyrange. The justification for this curve will be given later. <p></p> <center> <table border=""> <tbody> <tr> <td><a href="fig.1.gif"><img src="fig1.thumb.gif" align="left" /></a></td> <td><a href="fig.1.gif"> Figure 1.</a> The instrument noise levels of three magnetometers. Fluxgates A and B were not flown aboard spacecraft but served as backup units for space missions The search coil noise level is that of the OGO-3 instrument [<i>Russell et al</i>., 1970]. The dashed line is an extrapolation of the quietest interplanetary power spectrum obtained by <i>Siscoe</i> et al. [1968] assuming an f<img src="tiny-2.gif" align="top" /> spectral dependance.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </center>&nbsp; <p>We see that the noise spectrum of both fluxgatemagnetometers has a frequency dependence proportionalto l/<i>f</i> whereas the search coil noise has a 1/<i>f</i><img src="tiny_3.gif" align="top" />spectral dependence. The inverse cube dependence ofthe search coil noise results from a 1/<i>f</i> noise in fieldderivative units (nT/sec)<img src="tiny_2.gif" align="top" />/Hz (the search coil measures thederivative of the field), which is converted to field unitsnT<img src="tiny_2.gif" align="top" />/Hz by dividing by (2<img src="pi.gif" /><i>f</i>)<img src="tiny_2.gif" align="top" />, wherefis the frequency inHertz. The interplanetary power spectrum, however isproportional to 1/<i>f</i><img src="tiny_2.gif" align="top" />.Due to their different slopes allthree spectra cross. The flux gates intersect the quietinterplanetary spectrum at about 1 Hz. Thus, to theextent that these are representative of fluxgate magnetometers in actual operation in space, fluxgates shouldbe able to measure the quiet interplanetary spectrum toabout 1 Hz. Since The search coil noise spectrum crossesthe fluxgate noise spectrum at about 4 Hz, the searchcoil is the better high-frequency instrument. We note.however, that the search coil does not intersect ourhypothesized quiet interplanetary Spectrum until 15 Hz.Thus, to the extent that fluxgates <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are typical offluxgates used on actual missions we would expect thatthe quiet interplanetary spectrum from 1 to 15 Hzremains unmeasured. We shall see in fact our assumptionfor the quiet interplanctary spcctruln must not extendto frequencies much above 1 Hz and in reality the entireinterplanetary magnetic spectrum above 1 Hz remainsunobserved. In addition there are other sources of noisewhich limit the detection of the interplanetary spectrumat lower frequencies.</p> <p></p> <h3>ALIASING</h3>Aliasing is the folding of power about the Nyquistfrequency (half the sampling frequency) into the analysis band during spectral analysis of discretely sampledtime series. It does not create any power not originallypresent in the signal, but since it adds power fromoutside the analysis hand it can have drastic consequences on the measured spectrum. The way to avoid thisaddition of power due to aliasing is to remove any powerabove half the sampling frequency from the signal to bemeasured <i>before</i> the data are sampled by the telemetrysystem. Many times this has not been done on interplanetary magnetometers. Table 1 lists the Nyquist frequency and the upper cutoff frequency of the instrument for a number of magnetometers which have made measurements in the interplanetarymedium. The entriesare ranked according to ratio of these two frequencies.

Thus, for those instrumentswith much larger upper cutoffs than Nyquist frequencieswe must reinterpret our conclusions about their capabilityto resolve the quiet interplanetary spectrum.Examining <a href="fig.1.gif">Figure 1</a>,we see that this spectral folding ofthe instrument noise would limit them to measurementsbelow from about 0.1 to 0.2 Hz. </p> <p></p> <h3>DIGITAL NOISE</h3>The process of digitizing the magnetic field data addsfurther noise to the spectrum. This noise is subject toaliasing also, but in this case the folded power cannot beremoved in the instrument design. The ring noise due tothe digitization process can easily be shown to be <i>D</i> <img src="tiny_2.gif" align="top" />/ 12,where <i>D</i> is the size of a digital window [ <i>Bendat andPiersol</i>, 1966]. To understand how this noise affects ameasured spectrum, however, we must determine how itis distributed over the power spectrum. The moststraightforward way to accomplish this is to comparetwo spectra of the same time series: one digitized with alarge digital window, and one digitized with an extremely small digital window. For this purpose, timeseries were generated with a random number generatorwith a Gaussian distribution of amplitudes. These timeseries were then filtered with a digital single sectionlow-pass filter with a corner frequency below theanalysis band. The time series thus formed had a 1/ <i>f</i> <img src="tiny_2.gif" align="top" />power spectrum. <p><a href="fig.3.gif">Figure 3</a> shows two power spectra of the same timeseries with digital windows of 10<img src="tiny-5.gif" align="top" />nTand 0.5nT. Thespectra were computed from 2048 points with 50degrees of freedom. We note that there were only 315steps between digital windows in the coarsely digitizedtime series. The horizontal line is the power spectraldensity to be expected if the digitization noise of0.021 nT<img src="tiny_2.gif" align="top" />were spread uniformly over the analysis bandof 0.5 Hz.

Asurprising feature is that at low frequencies the coarselydigitized power spectrum is less than that of the finelydigitized power spectrum. In other words, at lowfrequencies the digitization process has consistentlyreduced the power, whereas at high frequencies it hasraised the power. This is not a chance event, but hasbeen observed in every test case.</p> <p><a href="fig.4.gif">Figure 4</a> shows the difference between these twopower spectra on a semi log plot together with a secondtest case. The second test case was performed on adifferent random time series but with the same spectralshape and integrated power. However, for the secondcase, the coarse digital window was set at 0.25 nT. Thiscoarsely digitized time series had 705 digital steps in the2048 points. The circled points indicate that the coarsedigitization spectrum was less than the fine digitizationspectrum. We see that at high frequencies the formula<i>D</i><img src="tiny_2.gif" align="top" />/12 <i>f</i><img src="sub.N.gif" /> is a good predictor of the digitization noiseadded to the spectrum, but that at low frequenciesdigitization actually reduces the power spectral density.</p> <p></p> <center> <table border=""> <tbody> <tr> <td><a href="fig.4.gif"><img src="fig4.thumb.gif" align="left" /></a></td> <td> <a href="fig.4.gif">Figure 4.</a> The difference between two pairs of-spectra of a random time series with an f<img src="tiny-2.gif" align="top" />spectral shape.

Thus, even when theorientation of tile interplanetary field is known, caremust be exercised in the interprelation of interplanetaryspectra obtained near the earth. However, from <a href="fig.5.gif">Figure 5</a>.we see that to extend our knowledge of the interplanetary spectrum much above 0.1 Hz we must examinenear-earth data. <p><a href="fig.6.gif">Figure 6</a> shows a power spectrum obtained in theinterplanetary medium by the OGO-1 search coil magnetometer [<i>Holzer et al</i>., 1966]. We see that it is at leasta factor of 2 higher than the noise level at the similarinstrument on OGO-3 but has a very similar slope. Theincreased power at low frequencies could be due tointerference near the OGO-1 spin frequency of 0.08 Hz.which was not present in OGO-3 search coil magnetometer data.Besides the possibility that this spectrumsimply shows the noise level of the magnetometer, thereis the possibility that this spectrum was contaminated bybow shock associated waves. This spectrum was obtainednear the earth (the apogee of OGO-1 was 24 R<img src="sub.E.gif" align="middle" />), and nodata were available on the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field at this time. Furthermore, thisspectrum differs significantly from others measured inthe same region.</p> <p></p> <center> <table border=""> <tbody> <tr> <td><a href="fig.6.gif"><img src="fig6.thumb.gif" align="left" /></a></td> <td><a href="fig.6.gif">Figure 6.</a> A comparison of the OGO-1 search coil measurement of the spectrum of the interplanetary magnetic field [<i>Holzer et al</i>, 1966] with the noise level of a simlilar instrument on board OCO-3 [<i>Russell et al.</i>, l970].</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </center>&nbsp; <p><a href="fig.7.gif">Figure 7 </a>shows power spectra of the three componentsof the interplanetary magnetic obtained by the UCLAOGO-5 fluxgate magnetometer in solar ecliptic coordinates calculated from 24,500 points with 500 degrees offreedom.

However, we note that duringthis spectrum the solar wind velocity was approximately400 km/sec and the density was 3.3 cm<img src="tiny-3.gif" align="top" />and bothquantities were changing only slowly over the course ofthe day [<i>J. Binsack, private communication 1970</i>]. Inother words, the solar wind was average during thisperiod of time. </p> <p></p> <h3>POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY OF THEINTERPLANETARY MAGNETIC FIELD</h3>Having discussed the possible errors in the measurementof the interplanetary power spectrum, we will now puttogether what we feel is the best estimate of theinterplanetary power spectrum. This is shown in <a href="fig.8.gif">Figure8</a>. At the lowest frequencies (10 <img src="tiny-6.gif" align="top" /> to 10 <img src="tiny-4.gif" align="top" />Hz) todefine accurately the power spectrum requires continuous data in the interplanetary medium for many days.Earth orbiting spacecraft cannot acquire such continuous data. Of the two series of interplanetary probes.the Mariner series and the Pioneer series spectra havebeen published for the lowest frequencies only for theMariner 2 [ <i>Coleman</i>, 1968] and Pioneer 6 data [Sari andNess, 1969]. However the normalization of the powerspectra of <i>Sari and Ness</i> [ 1969] are obviously incorrectand so we have used the Mariner 2 data in <a href="fig.8.gif">Figure 8</a>.Mariner 2 was launched during a very active period oftime and inward toward Venus. These two effects wouldtend to increase the power observed and indeed theMariner 2 curve appears to be somewhat high. We notethat since Tables <a href="#table1">1</a> and <a href="#table2">2</a> indicate a possible spectralfolding problem, we have plotted the Mariner 2 dataonly to one-quarter of its Nyquist frequency. <p></p> <center> <table border=""> <tbody> <tr> <td><a href="fig.8.gif"><img src="fig8.thumb.gif" align="left" /></a></td> <td><a href="fig.8.gif">Figure 8.</a> A composite spectrum of the radial component of the interplanetary magnetic field as observed on Mariner 2 [<i>Coleman</i>, 1968], on Mariner 4 [<i>Siscoe et al.</i>, 1968], and on OGO-5. Three spectra showing the range of variability of the interplanetary spectrum are shown for Mariner 4. Since the Mariner 2 data are consistently higher than the Mariner 4 data in the overlapping range of frequencies, it is assumed that the Mariner 2 data were obtained during an unusually disturbed period of time, and the typical spectrum has lower power. Three straight line segments have been drawn with slopes of -1, -1.5, -2 to roughly represent the expected average spectrum near 1 A U.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </center>&nbsp; <p>At the intermediate frequencies thc Mariner 4 [<i>Siscoeet al</i>., 1968] data have been used because these datahave been analyzed to show the range of variability ofthe spectrum. Active, intermediately active and quietspectra are shown. We note that the Mariner 4 spectraasymptotically approach a value of about 0.1 nT<img src="tiny_2.gif" align="top" />/Hz athigh frequencies, which is a factor of 2 lower than ourestimate of the digitization noise in <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>. This ispossibly because the Mariner 4 data samples are notequispaced as we have assumed in the calculation of thedigital noise level. Finally, at the highest frequencies wehave used the OGO-5 power spectrum shown in <a href="fig.7.gif">Figure 7</a>,which as suggested in the previous section, appears to betypical of average solar wind conditions since it joinssmoothly with the intermediate activity spectrum ofMariner 4. We note that although we have chosen to plotonly the power in the radial component on this figure,the other components have similar spectral form.</p> <p>On this figure we have drawn three straight lineswith slopes of -1, -1.5, and -2 with changes in slopeoccurring at 3 <img src="times.gif" /> 10<img src="tiny-4.gif" align="top" />and 10<img src="tiny-1.gif" align="top" /> Hz. We see that thesestraight lines are roughly parallel to the spectrum in thethree frequency ranges. The two breaks in tile spectrumare somewhat arbitrary, however, and <i>Sari and Ness</i>[1969] claim that the break between f<img src="tiny-1.5.gif" align="top" />and f<img src="tiny-2.gif" align="top" />occurs at about 5 <img src="times.gif" /> 10<img src="tiny-4.gif" align="top" />Hz. However, this is not clearfrom their data since they present no spectra that coverthe region of their hypothesized change in slope.</p> <p>Since <i>Russell et al</i>. [1970] showed that power spectraobtained in the interplanetary medium from 1 to 140 Hzwith the search coil magnetometer were at the instrument's noise level, there must be a further increase in theslope of the spectrum possibly from f<img src="tiny-2.gif" align="top" /> to J<img src="tiny-3.gif" align="top" />above1 Hz. However, no other limits on the possible spectrumabove 1 Hz can be determined with the present data.</p> <p></p> <h3>THE INTERPRETATION OF POWER SPECTRAOF THE INTERPLANETARY MAGNETIC FIELD</h3>It is tempting to interpret the changes in slope in <a href="fig.8.gif">Figure 8</a> as changes in allowed wave modes. and the like.However, all power spectra obtained in the interplanetary medium are measured in a frame of reference that ismoving at a very high velocity relative to the plasma restframe. For example, a 340-km/sec solar wind with anumber density of 4 cm <img src="tiny-3.gif" align="top" />and a magnetic field of 5 nT isstreaming past a spacecraft with a velocity of 6 times theAlfven velocity. Thus, waves propagating in the solarwind are severely Doppler shifted. The amount ofDoppler shifting depends on the size of the componentof the solar wind parallel to the phase velocity of thewave. If a wave is propagating perpendicular to the solarwind velocity, therefore, the Doppler shifting is zero.However, if a wave with phase velocity less than that ofthe solar wind (most electromagnetic waves undertypical solar wind conditions) is propagating parallel orantiparallel to the solar wind it will be severely Dopplershifted. Waves propagating parallel to the solar wind willbe Doppler shifted to higher frequencies maintainingtheir sense of polarization, and waves propagatinganti parallel to the solar wind will be Doppler shifted tolower frequencies if their phase velocity is greater thanhalf the solar wind velocity and to higher frequencies iftheir phase velocity is less than half the solar windvelocity. In both antiparallel propagation cases, however,the wave polarization observed in the satellite frame isreversed unless the phase velocity is greater than thesolar wind velocity. In short, then, the fact that the solarwind is flowing past the observer and is, in fact, usuallysuper Aifvenic and supersonic, mixes the power spectrum of the signal in the plasma rest frame as well asmixing cross correlations between components. Thus, itis not simple to interpret these power spectra.To understand the physical processes occurring in themagnetic field, such as which wave modes are present, itis essential to perform cross correlations with otherplasma parameters. <p>At present there is some controversy as to theimportance of discontinuities versus waves in determining the interplanetary power spectrum [<i>Sari andNess 1969; Belcher et al</i>., 1970] . Step functions in themagnetic field, whether they are propagating as waves orwhether they are simply convected with the solar windvelocity, will both contribute to a 1/f<img src="tiny_2.gif" align="top" /> spectrum at highfrequencies. (We note that the low-frequency spectrum,below approximately the frequency corresponding tothe average spacing of the discontinuities, need not beproportional to 1/f<img src="tiny_2.gif" align="top" /> ) Furthermore, there is no necessitythat the natural wave spectrum between discontinuitiesnot be proportional to 1/f<img src="tiny_2.gif" align="top" />.Thus, the spectral shape ofthe interplanetary spectrum provides no simple answerto this controversy. To distinguish between propagatingand non propagating structures requires examination ofboth the field and plasma behavior. We note theanisotropies in the solar wind plasma distributionsfurther complicate these identifications [<i>Hudson</i>,1970] .</p> <p></p> <h3>SUMMARY</h3>From our examination of the noise levels of two typicalflux gate magnetometers, it appears that most powerspectra of the interplanetary field fluctuations arelimited by digital noise rather than instrument noise.However, we have no guarantee that all magnetometersare this quiet. The OGO-1 and 3 search coil magnetometer,however, is limited by its inherent noise levelrather than digital noise; in fact, the spectrum of thisnoise level is greater than the power spectrum of theaverage interplanetary magnetic field at 1 AU. We note,however, the search coil magnetometer is a moresensitive instrument than the flux gate magnetometerabove about 4 Hz. <p>From our test cases, it appears that digital noise isdistributed uniformly over the power spectrum at leastat high frequencies. However, at low frequencies digitization actually reduced the power. Although this undoubtedly altered the powerspectra obtained in the interplanetary medium, its effect is small (<a href="fig.3.gif">Fig. 3</a>) and cannotaccount for the observed changes in slope.Aliasing could be a problem in the creation of powerspectra from the data for many of the interplanetarymagnetometers. However, due to the observed naturalspectrum of interplanetary fluctuations this should onlybe a serious problem for frequencies above one-half theNyquist frequency.</p> <p>Although the interplanetary spectrum near the earthcan be contaminated by waves associated with theearth's bow shock, we can combine OGO-5 data with theManner 2 and 4 interplanetary spectra to create thespectrum from about 5 <img src="times.gif" /> 10<img src="tiny-6.gif" align="top" /> Hz to 1 Hz, if care istaken to exclude times when the magnetic field linethreads both OGO-5 and the shock front. The spectrumof the radial component is approximately proportionalto f<img src="tiny-1.gif" align="top" />up to 3 <img src="times.gif" /> 10<img src="tiny-4.gif" align="top" /> Hz; then it is proportional tof<img src="tiny-1.5.gif" align="top" /> up to about 10<img src="tiny-1.gif" align="top" /> Hz; and finally it is proportionalabout f<img src="tiny-2.gif" align="top" />up to at least 1 Hz. It is quite probable thatthe spectrum undergoes another change in slope above1 Hz.</p> <p>Finally, we stress the difficulty in interpreting thepower spectrum of the interplanetary magnetic field byitself. Doppler shifting mixes frequencies and differentphysical processes can result in the same spectrum. Crosscorrelations with simultaneous plasma data are necessary. Multispacecraft studies could also be very fruitful.</p> <p></p> <h3>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h3>We wish to thank J.

Dr. Dean recommends the following for <strong>getting the maximum amount of magnesium from your diet</strong>: <ul> <li>Eat a wide variety of vegetables daily. Always include greens such as kale, collards, spinach, and curly-leaf lettuce, and magnesium-rich herbs such as dandelion, chickweed, and nettles. (Cilantro and purslane also have high amounts.)</li> <li>Enjoy starchy vegetables 3 or 4 times a week, such as red-skinned potatoes, winter squash, corn on the cob, lima beans, and burdock root.</li> <li>Eat fruits moderately.</li> <li>Include a variety of whole grains: buckwheat, millet, rye, oats, amaranth, and quinoa. </li> <li>Fish, shellfish, organic chicken, meat, turkey, or free-range eggs can be eaten once a day as rich animal protein sources.</li> <li>Have beans, tempeh, nuts, seeds, and legumes as a vegetarian source of protein daily.</li> <li>Use fresh and dry herbs in your cooking and include lots of garlic.</li> <li>Use organic cold-pressed oils for your cooking: extra-virgin olive oil, coconut oil, and sesame oil.</li> <li>Use organic butter in moderation.</li> <li>Take 1-2 tbsp of flaxseed oil daily.</li> <li>Use whole-grain breads and pasta.</li> <li>For sweetener use stevia.</li> <li>Drink natural spring, distilled, or filtered water only. [The more magnesium-rich, the better!]</li> <li>Enjoy organic herbal teas.</li> <li>Eat sea vegetables: dulse, nori, arame, wakame, kombu, and hijiki. All are exceedingly high in magnesium.</li> <li>Use natural raw, unheated nuts, seeds, and nut and seed butters, rich magnesium sources.</li> <li>Use a high-quality, mineral-rich sea salt.</li> </ul> <br /> <h2>Foods to Avoid (Read Labels Thoroughly):</h2> <ul> <li>All refined and processed foods of any kind, such as cookies, doughnuts, bagels, white bread, luncheon meats, and soy protein powder.</li> <li>All refined and processed sugars, including fructose or corn syrup and diet products with artificial sweeteners such as aspartame (NutraSweet and Splenda). </li> <li>All dairy products except organic butter and free-range eggs.</li> <li>Regular and decaffeinated coffee and black tea. </li> <li>Any foods containing hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils or trans fatty acids.</li> <li>All alcoholic beverages.</li> <li>Pasteurized fruit juices and sodas.</li> <li>Foods containing MSG, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, and chemical preservatives.</li> <li>Commercial iodized salt.</li> </ul> <br /> <h2>A Magnesium Eating Plan:</h2>(From Dr. Dean’s book, <em>The Magnesium Miracle</em>) <br /> <br /> <strong>Upon Rising:</strong> Juice of 1/2 - 1 fresh lemon in warm water. Sweeten with stevia. <br /> <br /> <strong>Breakfast:</strong> <ul> <li>Crockpot cereal with flaxseed oil and fresh or frozen blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, banana, peach, or pear.</li> <li>Choose two grains, one nut, one seed from: buckwheat, millet, rye, oats, amaranth, quinoa, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, almonds, cashews, filberts, walnuts, pecans.</li> <li>For one person, put 2 oz of dry mixture in 5 oz of water in a 1-quart Crockpot. Cook overnight. In the morning place in a bowl, add 2-4 oz fruit, mix, and add 2 tbsp of flaxseed oil or 1 tbsp of organic butter, or 2 tbsp of ground flaxseeds (ground fresh in a coffee grinder). You may add rice milk, almond milk, or small amounts of soy milk as needed. For extra magnesium, sprinkle on wheat germ (kept in the freezer).</li> </ul> <strong>Substitutions:</strong> <ol> <li>Instead of using a Crockpot, you can soak 2 ox of grain mixture overnight in 5 oz. of water, with or without 2 tbsp of plain yogurt. In the morning bring to a boil and let simmer on the lowest setting for 20 minutes. You may have to add more water to avoid dryness. Serve with 2 tbsp ground flaxseeds (ground fresh in a coffee grinder).</li> <li>Instead of soaking overnight, cook 2 oz of grain mixture in 6 oz of water. Bring to a boil and let simmer for 30 min.</li> </ol> <strong>Lunch [Choose one]:</strong> <ul> <li>Brown rice and vegetables. Cooked with 2 oz dulse or other sea vegetables.</li> <li>Leafy green salad, soup with added sea vegetables, and Essene sprouted bread or Ezekiel bread.</li> <li>Fish, greens (collards, spinach, swiss chard), and salad.</li> <li>Egg omelet with saut&eacute;ed vegetables.</li> <li>Chicken with vegetables.</li> </ul> <strong>Dinner [Choose one]:</strong> <ul> <li>Soup (with sea vegetables) and salad.</li> <li>Stir-fried grains (leftover grains from breakfast) and vegetables.</li> <li>Roasted vegetables with wild rice.</li> <li>Salad with cooked organic legumes (kidney beans, lentils, black beans, chickpeas).</li> <li>Wheat-free pasta (rice, spelt, kamut) with pesto, tomato sauce, and green vegetables.</li> <li>Mixed salad with avocado.</li> </ul> <strong>Snacks:</strong> <ul> <li>Raw vegetables.</li> <li>Dried fruit (prunes and figs).</li> <li>Shelled nuts and seeds (raw, not processed or salted).</li> <li>Backed blue corn chips.</li> <li>Popcorn.</li> </ul> <strong>Drinks:</strong> <ul> <li>Pure, clean water that is high in magnesium and low in calcium. </li> <li>Green tea.</li> <li>Freshly squeezed lemon juice in water.</li> <li>Cranberry juice sweetened with stevia.</li> <li>Herbal teas.</li> <li>Kukicha (roasted twig tea).<sup><a href="/resources/magnesium-rich-foods-plan.html#1">1</a></sup></li> </ul> <br /> <h2>Like Dr. Dean says though...</h2> <strong>Getting enough magnesium from your food alone (even on the most magnesium-rich diet) is nearly impossible.</strong> She encourages everyone to take a highly absorbable magnesium supplement in order to give your body what it needs for optimal health. <sup><a href="/resources/magnesium-rich-foods-plan.html#2">2</a></sup> <br /> <br /> <h2>Jigsaw Health’s Magnesium w/SRT</h2>Dr. Dean recommends <a href="/supplements/magnesium_supplement.html">Jigsaw Magnesium w/ SRT</a> because it is a <strong>premier quality magnesium supplement that is formulated for maximum absorption and potency as dimagnesium malate.</strong> <sup><a href="/resources/magnesium-rich-foods-plan.html#3">3</a></sup> <br /> <br />And unlike most other magnesium supplements, Jigsaw Magnesium w/ SRT does not cause diarrhea because of its sustained release technology. <br /> <br />Learn more about the <a href="/supplements/magnesium_supplement.html">many benefits</a> of Jigsaw Magnesium w/SRT. <br /> <br /> <blockquote> <h2><a href="/resources/magnesium-rich-foods-main.html">Return to &quot;Magnesium-Rich Food: Is it a Contradiction in Terms?&quot; article.</a></h2> </blockquote> <br /> <br /> <hr /> <br /> <h2>Cited Sources</h2> <ol> <li><a name="1"></a>Dean, p. 234-238</li> <li><a name="2"></a>16.

It took hearing about the $10.00 off promotion to finally get my lazy butt in gear enough to order. :) Once I got to your site, I found so many other rare products that I ended up not even getting the magnesium for now, lol. I very much like your site, particularly the ease of using a drop-down menu to access each product. Love the detailed product information, right down to the Supplement Facts panel.

But treatment success rates for these fistulas now approach 100 percent when the repairs are performed early by experienced specialists. Contemporary endoscopic techniques have also made treatment of these fistulas far less risky.</p> <p>“Mortality from the treatments is extremely rare,” said Neil R. Miller, MD, professor of ophthalmology, neurology and neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins, “and the morbidity is quite low—usually nothing more than double vision or some pain that goes away within a few days to a few weeks.”</p> <p>Prompt diagnosis, however, remains a challenge, according to Mark J. Kupersmith, MD, director of neuro-ophthalmology for the Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery at Roosevelt Hospital and New York Eye and Ear Infirmary in New York City. The diagnosis is often missed, leading to months of inappropriate therapy and, in some patients, vision loss due to treatment delay.</p> <p><a href="#__topdoc__"><img height="19" alt="Top" hspace="0" src="/images/14720651.gif" width="19" border="0" /></a></p> <p><strong><span class="eyenet_topic">Two Types of Arterial Diversion</span></strong></p> <p>CCFs are classified as direct or dural.</p> <p><b>Direct CCFs</b> involve a tear or hole in a branch artery arising from the internal carotid artery within the cavernous sinus. These fistulas typically result from some type of trauma, like a car accident or mugging. But some are iatrogenic, occurring during a neurosurgical or interventional neuroradiological procedure. And others result from a spontaneous rupture of a carotid artery aneurysm in the cavernous sinus.</p> <p><b>Dural arteriovenous shunts</b> are abnormal communications between the cavernous sinus and one or more meningeal branches of the internal carotid artery, external carotid artery or both. Shunts involving both arterial distributions are the most common.<sup>1</sup> The pathogenesis of dural fistulas is unclear, but it appears that they originate from tiny arteriovenous shunts in the dura that are normal variants. “For some reason—possibly the effects of an angiogenesis factor—the shunts begin to proliferate and become abnormal,” Dr. Kupersmith said. “They are usually associated with occlusion in the adjacent draining venous dural sinuses, such as the cavernous sinus. Suddenly there is a little arterialized blood flow into the venous system and a compromised egress of normal blood from the venous system because of thrombosis. The result is a symptomatic arteriovenous shunt.” Risk factors for the development of a dural CCF include systemic hypertension, atherosclerotic vascular disease, pregnancy, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and minor trauma.</p> <p><a href="#__topdoc__"><img height="19" alt="Top" hspace="0" src="/images/14720651.gif" width="19" border="0" /></a></p> <p><strong><span class="eyenet_topic">Subtle Signs and Symptoms</span></strong></p> <p>The clinical presentation of a CCF is influenced by the type and size of the fistula as well as its location, blood flow rate and drainage route. Some evidence suggests that many dural fistulas drain posteriorly first—into the inferior petrosal sinus, basilar venous plexus or both—and then anteriorly as the initial pathway becomes blocked. Posterior drainage usually produces no ocular symptoms, although some patients may experience a cranial neuropathy, such as facial paresis or ocular motor nerve paresis. Ocular signs and symptoms typically arise as the drainage shifts to an anterior route via the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins. Because of their lower flow rate, dural CCFs usually produce less severe symptoms than those from a direct CCF. Objective and subjective bruits also are less common with dural fistulas.</p> <p><b>Easy to misinterpret.</b> Dr. Kupersmith said dural CCFs can have a subtle presentation, including a mildly red eye with little or no proptosis, elevation in intraocular pressure, mild discomfort, secondary glaucoma, venous congestion to the retina and some ophthalmoparesis with double vision.</p> <p>“These patients are often misdiagnosed as having thyroid eye disease or conjunctivitis or blepharitis,” Dr. Miller noted. But several telltale signs can point to the diagnosis. Patients with an arteriovenous shunt or fistula typically have small, tortuous corkscrew-type blood vessels in the conjunctiva that come up to the limbus and appear different from those seen with the other ocular conditions. In contrast to generalized conjunctivitis, these vessels are localized to certain areas, such as the interpalpebral conjunctiva. IOP is elevated on the involved side, and standard applanation tonometry reveals a larger ocular pulse amplitude in that eye compared with the noninvolved eye. Ophthalmoscopic findings can be normal, or they may reveal a slight dilation of the retinal veins.</p> <p><b>When worse gets worse.</b> Advanced dural fistulas, particularly those with significant orbital or cavernous sinus venous occlusion, may cause periorbital or retrobulbar discomfort and possibly facial pain. Rising episcleral venous pressure can increase intraocular pressure. Elevated venous pressure in the orbit, congestion in the iris and choroid and displacement of the iris-lens diaphragm may lead to angle-closure glaucoma. Ophthalmoscopic findings may include intraretinal hemorrhages; retinal detachments; vitreous hemorrhages; choroidal folds, effusions and detachments; or swelling of the disc.</p> <p><b>Delayed diagnosis puts vision at risk.</b> Dr. Kupersmith noted that failure to recognize the different characteristics of the red eye that results from a dural fistula compared to those seen with an inflammatory process or glaucoma can send patients on a frustrating odyssey from one ophthalmologist to another.</p> <p>“Some ophthalmologists will look at the red eye quickly and give an antibiotic or steroid drop,” Dr. Kupersmith said. “They may not even check the patient’s pressure out of concern that it is an infectious process. When the patient comes back with elevated pressure, the ophthalmologist thinks it may be elevated because of the steroid drops—so ophthalmologists are missing the process. People who come to see us are aggravated because they have been from doctor to doctor for month upon month until someone finally puts it all together.” He added that patients with an atypical red eye might be asked whether they hear a pulsatile bruit.</p> <p>About 20 to 30 percent of all dural fistulas lead to vision loss, usually due to uncontrolled glaucoma, ischemic optic neuropathy or chorioretinal dysfunction.</p> <p><b>How to get the correct diagnosis.</b> A catheter angiogram is the best diagnostic test for CCFs. But ophthalmologists who suspect a fistula can order one or more noninvasive imaging studies to support their suspicions. These options include computed tomography, angiography, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging that concentrates on the cavernous sinus and MR angiography that does not “cut off” the dural arteries.</p> <p>“Ophthalmologists can order an MRI with contrast, pointing out to the neuroradiologist that they are looking for an arteriovenous shunt to the cavernous sinus,” Dr. Kupersmith said. “The more information they give the neuroradiologist, the better the information they will receive in return. The ophthalmologist also should ask the neuroradiologist to make sure there is no precarious or abnormal venous drainage from the brain.”</p> <p><a href="#__topdoc__"><img height="19" alt="Top" hspace="0" src="/images/14720651.gif" width="19" border="0" /></a></p> <p><strong><span class="eyenet_topic">Endovascular Treatment</span></strong></p> <p>Dr. Miller said that patients with mild ocular symptoms can be observed to determine whether the fistula will close spontaneously, as do about 20 to 50 percent. During this observation period, patients’ visual function, IOP and ophthalmoscopic appearance should be monitored regularly.</p> <p>Persistent diplopia can be managed with prism therapy or occlusion of one eye, and proptosis-related keratopathy can be relieved with ocular lubrication.</p> <p>For significantly elevated IOP, Dr. Miller suggests that topical agents be tried for a few weeks. If IOP remains severely elevated, closure of the fistula is the best treatment. Dr. Kupersmith cautions that intraocular surgery to control the secondary glaucoma or unrelated cataract carries a high risk because of the orbital venous hypertension.</p> <p><b>Close hole, keep artery open.</b> Fortunately, treatment safety and success have increased dramatically over the years. “Previously, in many cases, nothing was done because you’d have to close the entire internal carotid artery or the external carotid artery, or both, and there was a risk of stroke and neurologic dysfunction,” Dr. Miller noted. “Today people can be treated relatively noninvasively with endovascular techniques in which substances such as glue or platinum coils are placed in the fistula, with preservation of the major artery.”</p> <p><b>Platinum is the new gold.</b> The successful closure rate with detachable platinum coils ranges from 90 to100 percent. These coils remain the preferred material at the University of California, Los Angeles, where they were developed, according to Robert A. Goldberg, MD, professor of ophthalmology and chief of orbit and ophthalmic plastic surgery there. “Work is constantly being done on some of the newer agents—for example, some of the foams—but for fistulas in the cavernous sinus, I think the preference here is still coils.”</p> <p><b>Calling expert collaborators.</b> Some dural fistulas can be treated by an interventional neuroradiologist alone, whereas others require a team approach. “Having an orbital specialist or neuro-ophthalmologist involved is often helpful,” Dr. Goldberg noted. “Sometimes there is the need to access the vein through the orbit.

In reality, fossils are a great embarrassment to Evolutionary theory and offer strong support for the concept of Creation. If Evolution were true, we should find literally millions of fossils that show how one kind of life slowly and gradually changed to another kind of life. But missing links are the trade secret, in a sense, of paleontology. The point is, the links are still missing. What we really find are gaps that sharpen up the boundaries between kinds. It's those gaps which provide us with the evidence of Creation of separate kinds. As a matter of fact, there are gaps between each of the major kinds of plants and animals. Transition forms are missing by the millions. What we do find are separate and complex kinds, pointing to Creation.&quot;</font></font> <br /><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size="+0">(Dr Gary Parker Biologist/paleontologist and former ardent Evolutionist.)</font></font> </p><p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size="+0">&quot;Many species remain virtually unchanged for millions of years, then suddenly disappear to be replaced by a quite different, but related, form.

This predicted pattern is called phyletic gradualism. Darwin recognized that phyletic gradualism is not often revealed by the fossil record. Studies conducted since Darwin�s time likewise have failed to produce the continuous series of fossils predicted by phyletic gradualism. Is the theory of gradualism therefore refuted? Darwin and others claim that it is not, because the fossil record is too imperfect to preserve transitional series...Others have argued, however, that the abrupt origins and extinctions of species in the fossil record force us to conclude that phyletic gradualism is rare. &quot;</font></font> <br /><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size="+0">&quot;A number of contemporary biologists, however, favor various hypotheses of the punctuated equilibrium theory...They base their hypotheses on fossil records which have large �chains� of missing organisms.

I have already mentioned that the ordinary viewpoint of evolution held by most paleontologists favours gradual incremental change. The fossil record, they say, is too incomplete to take seriously. And, they say, you cannot prove a gap. But of course you can prove a gap, especially if clines occurred. If there is a break in the record it must be possible to detect the break. The main point about breaks is that, if they were really random, as proposed by Darwin, they must have been plugged by one hundred and fifty years of work. But the gaps have not been plugged. They still persist; yet authorities still plead the cause of failure of preservation. Such authorities forget that if there is a million to one chance of one specimen of a population, and then if that species lived 5-15 m.y., we therefore get 5-15 times the population fossilized. The trouble may perhaps have lain more truthfully in our failur to find or describe the material.

Eldredge and Gould equate such appearances with speciation, although the details of these events are not preserved. They suggest that change occurs rapidly, by geologic standards, in small, peripheral populations. They believe that evolution is accelerated in such populations because they contain a small, random sample of the gene pool of the parent population (founder effect) and therefore can diverge rapidly just by chance and because they can respond to local selection pressures that may differ from those encountered by the parent population.

Eldredge and Gould certainly would agree that some very important gaps really are due to imperfections in the fossil record. Very big gaps, too. For example the Cambrian strata of rocks, vintage about 600 million years, are the oldest ones in which we find most of the major invertebrate groups. And we find many of them already in an advanced state of evolution, the very first time they appear. It is as though they were just planted there, without any evolutionary history. Needless to say, this appearance of sudden planting has delighted creationists. Evolutionists of all stripes believe, however, that this really does represent a very large gap in the fossil record, a gap that is simply due to the fact that, for some reason, very few fossils have lasted from periods before about 600 million years ago. One good reason might be that many of these animals had only soft parts to their bodies: no shells or bones to fossilize. If you are a creationist you may think that this is special pleading. My point here is that, when we are talking about gaps of this magnitude, there is no difference whatever in the interpretations of `punctuationists' and `gradualists'. Both schools of thought despise so-called scientific creationists equally, and both agree that the major gaps are real, that they are true imperfections in the fossil record.

Darwin used the only illustration in the first edition of The Origin of Species to explain his hypothesis that the patterns of evolution over hundreds of millions of generations were the same as those at the level of populations and species. In fact, they are clearly distinct in all taxonomic groups. Evolution at the level of populations and species might, in some cases, appear as nearly continuous change accompanied by divergence to occupy much of the available morphospace. However, this is certainly not true for long-term, large-scale evolution, such as that of the metazoan phyla, which include most of the taxa that formed the basis for the evolutionary synthesis. The most striking features of large-scale evolution are the extremely rapid divergence of lineages near the time of their origin, followed by long periods in which basic body plans and ways of life are retained. What is missing are the many intermediate forms hypothesized by Darwin, and the continual divergence of major lineages into the morphospace between distinct adaptive types. The most conspicuous event in metazoan evolution was the dramatic origin of major new structures and body plans documented by the Cambrian explosion. Until 530 million years ago, multicellular animals consisted primarily of simple, soft-bodied forms, most of which have been identified from the fossil record as cnidarians and sponges. Then, within less then 10 million years, almost all of the advanced phyla appeared, including echinoderms, chordates, annelids, brachiopods, molluscs and a host of arthropods. The extreme speed of anatomical change and adaptive radiation during this brief time period requires explanations that go beyond those proposed for the evolution of species within the modern biota.&quot;</font></font> <br /><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size="+0">(Carroll, Robert L.

When paleontologists thought that no fossils were to be found in any older rocks, they did not leap to the conclusion that life had all of a sudden been invented at the beginning of Cambrian times. Particularly because Darwin had so convincingly argued that life evolves slowly, requiring huge amounts of time to accumulate significant change, few paleontologists of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were willing to claim that the apparently sudden advent of complex creatures 575 million years ago was an actual evolutionary event. They preferred to see it as an artifact of geological processes: they noted that most older rocks were either igneous or the metamorphosed remnants of sedimentary rocks whose fossils had been baked and squeezed out of existence. Life *had* been there in those earlier eons, they felt sure, but simply had not survived the ravages of time. Especially since life had diversified into a wondrous array of mollusks (snails, clams, and the like), arthropods (trilobites plus more modern groups such as insects and crustaceans), echinoderms (the starfish/sea urchin clan), brachiopods (the dominant shellfish group of ancient seas) and other, less-well-known creatures, paleontologists quite naturally felt that there must have been a truly long period of slow evolution to allow all these different forms to derive front the common ancestor they were supposed to have shared. Wrong on both counts. Careful paleontological detective work begun in the 1950s has revealed an extensive, if elusive, early fossil record. And this new Precambrian paleontology has made us take that early Cambrian event much more seriously, for it does not bear out the predicted long, slow history of diversification of complex life. That early Cambrian spurt of life looms now as one of the most important ecological and genealogical events in the entire history of life. And the events leading up to it, during life's first 3 billion years, give little inkling of what was to follow. The stage was set in those first 3 billion years, but only in the most general sort of way: looking at that unbelievably long and seemingly almost uneventful early history of life, there was simply no way anyone could have anticipated what happened so relatively quickly when complex animal life finally appeared on the scene.&quot;</font></font> <br /><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size="+0">(Eldredge N., &quot;Life Pulse: Episodes from the Story of the fossil Record,&quot; Facts on File: New York NY, 1987, pp.23-24.

It is in this latter class of model that we believe the record favors.&quot; &quot;... many of the large populations should have been preserved, yet we simply do not find them. Small populations are called for, then, but there are difficulties here also. The populations must remain small (and undetected) and evolve steadily and consistently toward the body plan that comprises the basis of a new phylum (or class). This is asking a lot. Deleterious mutations would tend to accumulate in small populations to form genetic loads that selection might not be able to handle. Stable intermediate adaptive modes cannot be invoked as a regular feature, since we are then again faced with the problem of just where their remains are. We might imagine vast arrays of such small populations fanning continually and incessantly into adaptive space. Vast arrays should have produced at least some fossil remains also. Perhaps an even greater difficulty is the requirement that these arrays of lineages change along a rather straight and true course --- morphological side trips or detours of any frequency should lengthen the time of origin of higher taxa beyond what appears to be available. Why should an opportunistic, tinkering process set on such a course and hold it for so long successfully among so many lineages?&quot;</font></font> <br /><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size="+0">&quot;We conclude that the extrapolation of microevolutionary rates to explain the origin of new body plans is possible, but does not accord with the primary evidence.&quot;</font></font> <br /><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size="+0">&quot;The required rapidity of the change implies either a few large steps or many and exceedingly rapid smaller ones. Large steps are tantamount to saltations and raise the problems of fitness barriers; small steps must be numerous and entail the problems discussed under microevolution. The periods of stasis raise the possibility that the lineage would enter the fossil record, and we reiterate that we can identify none of the postulated intermediate forms. Finally, the large numbers of species that must be generated so as to form a pool from which the successful lineage is selected are nowhere to be found. We conclude that the probability that species selection is a general solution to the origin of higher taxa is not great, and that neither of the contending theories of evolutionary change at the species level, phyletic gradualism or punctuated equilibrium, seem applicable to the origin of new body plans.&quot;</font></font> <br /><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size="+0">(Valentine, J., and Erwin, D.

The full flowering of this initial fauna reaches its finest expression in the exquisite, soft-bodied fossils of the Burgess Shale, subject of my recent book, Wonderful Life. This basic pattern has been well publicized and is now known to most nonprofessionals with strong interests in the history of life: a long period of unicellular creatures only; followed by a rapid appearance of the Ediacara fauna, perhaps with no relationship to living animals; and the final, equally quick, origin of modern anatomical designs in the Cambrian Explosion, with maximum expression soon thereafter in the Burgess Shale.&quot;</font></font> <br /><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size="+0">(Gould S.J., &quot;Defending the Heretical and the Superfluous,&quot; in &quot;Eight Little Piggies: Reflections in Natural History,&quot; Jonathan Cape: London, 1993, p.329)</font></font> </p><p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size="+0">&quot;The Cambrian then began with an assemblage of bits and pieces, frustratingly difficult to interpret, called the &quot;small shelly fauna.&quot; The subsequent main pulse, starting about 530 million years ago, constitutes the famous Cambrian explosion, during which all but one modern phylum of animal life made a first appearance in the fossil record. (Geologists had previously allowed up to 40 million years for this event, but an elegant study, published in 1993, clearly restricts this period of phyletic flowering to a mere five million years.)

An &quot;external&quot; explanation based on ecology seems attractive: the Cambrian explosion represents an initial filling of the &quot;ecological barrel&quot; of niches for multicellular organisms, and any experiment found a space. The barrel has never emptied since; even the great mass extinctions left a few species in each principal role, and their occupation of ecological space forecloses opportunity for fundamental novelties. But an &quot;internal&quot; explanation based on genetics and development also seems necessary as a complement: the earliest multicellular animals may have maintained a flexibility for genetic change and embryological transformation that became greatly reduced as organisms &quot;locked in&quot; to a set of stable and successful designs. In any case, this initial period of both internal and external flexibility yielded a range of invertebrate anatomies that may have exceeded (in just a few million years of production) the full scope of animal form in all the earth's environments today (after more than 500 million years of additional time for further expansion). Scientists are divided on this question. Some claim that the anatomical range of this initial explosion exceeded that of modern life, as many early experiments died out and no new phyla have ever arisen. But scientists most strongly opposed to this view allow that Cambrian diversity at least equaled the modern range-so even the most cautious opinion holds that 500 million subsequent years of opportunity have not expanded the Cambrian range, achieved in just five million years.

You only have to think for one moment about what `top down' filling in would have to mean for the animals on the ground and you immediately see how preposterous it is. 'Body plans' like the mollusc body plan, or the echinoderm body plan, are not ideal essences hanging in the sky, waiting, like designer dresses, to be adopted by real animals. Real animals is all there ever was: living, breathing, walking, eats , excreting, fighting, copulating real animals, who had to survive and who can't have been dramatically different from their real parents and grandparents. For a new body plan-a new phylum-to spring into existence, what actually has to happen on the ground is that a child is born which suddenly, out of the blue, is as different from its parents as a snail is from an earthworm. No zoologist who thinks through the implications, not even the most ardent saltationist, has ever supported any such notion. Ardent saltationists have been content to postulate the sudden bursting into existence of new *species*, and even that relatively modest idea has been highly controversial.

Why this lamentable blank? Various theories have been proposed; none is too satisfactory. It has been suggested, for example, that all the Pre-Cambrian sediments were deposited on continental areas, and the absence of fossils in them is due to the fact that all the older animals were sea-dwellers. But that all these older sediments were continental is a theory which opposes, without proof, everything we know of deposition in later times. Again, it is suggested that the Pre-Cambrian seas were poor in calcium carbonate, necessary for the production of preservable skeletons; but this is not supported by geochemical evidence. Yet again, it is argued that even though conditions were amenable to the formation of fossilizable skeletal parts, the various phyla only began to use these possibilities at the dawn of the Cambrian. But it is, a priori, hard to believe that the varied types present in the early Cambrian would all have, so to speak, decided to put on armour simultaneously. And, once again, it has been argued that the whole evolution of multicellular animals took place with great rapidity in late Pre-Cambrian times, so that a relatively short gap in rock deposition would account for the absence of any record of their rise. Perhaps; but the known evolutionary rate in most groups from the Cambrian on is a relatively leisurely one, and it is hard to convince oneself that a sudden major burst of evolutionary advance would be so promptly followed by a marked 'slowdown'.

Romer's 1966 treatise, *Vertebrate Paleontology*, that mainstream paleontologists have found no fossil record of transitional chordates leading up to the appearance of the first class of fishes, the Agnatha, or of transitional forms between the primitive, jawless agnaths and the jaw-bearing class Placodermi, or of transition from the placoderms (which were poorly structured for swimming) to the class Chondrichthyes, or from those cartilaginous-skeleton sharklike fishes to the class Osteicthyes, or bony fishes [cites Gish's earlier book]. The evolution of these classes is shown in Figure 43.1. Neither, says Gish, is there any record of transitional forms leading to the rise of the lungfishes and the crossopterygians from the lobe-finned bony fishes, an evolutionary step that is supposed to have led to the rise of amphibians and ultimately to the conquest of the lands by air-breathing vertebrates.In a series of quotations from Romer (1966), Gish finds all the confessions he needs from the evolutionists that each of these classes appears suddenly and with no trace of ancestors. The absence of transitional fossils in the gaps between each group of fishes and its ancestor is repeated in standard treatises on vertebrate evolution. Even Chris McGowan's 1984 anticreationist work, purporting to show &quot;why creationists are wrong,&quot; makes no mention of Gish's four pages of text on the origin of the fish classes. Knowing that McGowan is an authority on vertebrate paleontology, keen on faulting the creationists at every opportunity, I must assume that I haven't missed anything important in this area.

For example, John Allroy of the National Museum of National History in Washington, D.C, says pulling the mesonychians out of the picture makes a closer cetacean-artiodactyl link plausible. But O'Leary says &quot;it's [still] difficult to connect hippos with whales in the fossil record.&quot; The molecular camp, for its part, viewed Thewissen's conclusion as just a first step toward ultimate vindication.

Lack of oxygen causes characteristic chest pain and death of myocardial tissue.</p> <p>Heart attacks are more likely to occur when arteries have already been substantially narrowed by years of coronary heart disease. Plaque (composed of cholesterol-rich fatty deposits, collagen and other proteins, and excess smooth muscle cells) builds up in the arterial walls, a process known as atherosclerosis. Arterial walls thicken and narrow, inhibiting the flow of blood into the heart.</p> <p>When arterial walls have been roughened by plaque deposits, it becomes much easier for blood clots to form along the surface of the plaque. If the clots grow, or if they detach from their place of origin and are carried along to a narrower section of artery, they may block a coronary artery completely, causing a heart attack. Arteries may also narrow suddenly as a result of an arterial spasm.</p> <p>One-third of all heart attacks occur with no prior warning signs. In the remainder, attacks of chest pain (angina) brought about by stress or exertion occur periodically for months or years prior to a heart attack. In some cases a mild heart attack produces no symptoms—a so-called silent heart attack.</p> <p>Prompt emergency medical attention is crucial: If treatment is received within a few hours of the onset of a heart attack, chances for survival are good. Improved treatment methods—including the administration of thrombolytic (clot dissolving) drugs and angioplasty (inflation of a tiny balloon at the site of the blockage to widen the artery and permit the flow of blood through the artery)—have led to a steady decrease in mortality from heart attacks.</p> <p>However, the best treatment remains prevention. The process of atherosclerosis may be halted or even reversed with fairly simple measures, and the risk of heart attack can thus be reduced.</p> <p><a name="2"></a><strong>Symptoms of Heart Attack</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li> Chest pain or pressure, tightness, squeezing, burning, aching, or heaviness in the chest, lasting longer than 10 minutes. The pain or discomfort is usually located in the center of the chest just under the breastbone and may radiate down the arm (especially the left), up into the neck, or along the jaw line.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> Shortness of breath.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> Profuse sweating.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> Dizziness.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> Muscle weakness.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> Nausea and vomiting.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> A choking sensation.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> Anxiety, or a feeling of impending doom.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> No symptoms occur with a silent heart attack. </li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a name="3"></a><strong>What Causes Heart Attack?</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li> Blood clots that block a coronary artery are the most common cause of heart attacks. Clots develop on plaque in a coronary artery. Pieces of a clot may also be carried along the coronary artery and cause an obstruction.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> Severely narrowed arteries due to atherosclerosis underlie the development of a heart attack.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> Cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol levels, a diet rich in saturated fat (especially animal fat), obesity, lack of exercise, and diabetes mellitus all promote atherosclerosis and thus increase the risk of heart attacks.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> A family history of early or premature heart attacks (before the age of 55 in men and 65 in women) increases the risk of heart attack.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> Men have a significantly higher risk of heart attack than premenopausal women. But the risk for postmenopausal women approaches that of men as estrogen production decreases with menopause.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> Risk increases with age: Heart attacks are most common after age 65.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> A spasm of the muscles of the arterial walls may cause a heart attack by narrowing an artery. Spasms may be triggered by smoking, extreme emotional stress, or exposure to very cold air or water.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> Abuse of cocaine or amphetamines may cause a sudden heart attack even in those with no signs of heart disease.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> Heavy exertion, such as shoveling snow or carrying heavy objects up stairs, and severe emotional stress may trigger a heart attack.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> Having had one heart attack increases the risk of future heart attacks. </li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a name="4"></a><strong>Prevention of Heart Attack</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li> Don’t smoke. Your doctor may recommend methods for quitting, including nicotine replacement.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> Eat a diet low in fat, cholesterol, and salt.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> See your doctor regularly for blood pressure and cholesterol monitoring.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> Pursue a program of moderate, regular aerobic exercise. People over age 50 who have led a sedentary lifestyle should check with a doctor before beginning an exercise program.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> Lose weight if you are overweight.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> Your doctor may advise you to take a low dose of aspirin regularly. Aspirin reduces the tendency for the blood to clot, thereby decreasing the risk of heart attack. However, such a regimen should only be initiated under a doctor’s expressed recommendation. </li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a name="5"></a><strong>Diagnosis of Heart Attack</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li> Patient history and physical examination are needed. Diagnosis will often be made immediately by a doctor or emergency response technician.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> An electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed. This test measures changes in the electrical activity of the heart that result from abnormalities in the flow of blood.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> Blood tests measure the release of enzymes from damaged heart muscle into the bloodstream.<p>&nbsp;</p></li> <li> A coronary angiography (using a tiny catheter inserted into an artery in a leg or arm and threaded up the artery to the heart) is performed to locate the arterial blockage prior to angioplasty or bypass surgery. A contrast material is then injected from the end of the catheter into the coronary arteries, and a high-speed series of x-rays is taken. </li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a name="6"></a><strong>How To Treat Heart Attack</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li> It is advised to chew on an aspirin at the onset of the symptoms of a heart attack. It may help break up the clot. <div class="panel panelBox panelStoryNotify"> <div class="panelHeader"> <h3>Notify Me</h3> </div> <div class="panelContent clear"> <p>Would you like us to inform you
