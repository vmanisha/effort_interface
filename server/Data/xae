epilepsy has been the 'rediscovery' of the ketogenic diet. This diet is helping children whose seizures have resisted even the best of the modern anticonvulsant drugs.&quot; <br /> -C Dr. McIntyre Burnham, President, Epilepsy Ontario. <br /> <br />The ketogenic diet is a rigid, strictly calculated, therapeutic diet used in the treatment of difficult to control epilepsy in children. This diet is very high in fats and very low in protein and carbohydrates. <br /> <br />There are a few different ways to do a keto-diet, the first is a 'Standard Ketogenic Diet', or a SKD.� This is where you just restrict carbs, go into ketosis, and stay there for long periods until you've reached your fat loss goals, sometimes going back on carbs for a couple days or a week at a time.� Next is a 'Targeted Ketogenic Diet', or TKD.� A TKD is the same as an SKD, but you take in 25-50 grams of carbs about 30-60 minutes before weightlifting workouts to supply energy for the muscles (Note: These carbs will be burned during the workout, and should not be counted towards the 30g/day limit).� Last is a 'Cyclic Ketogenic Diet', a CKD, which is much more complex.� On a CKD, you go into ketosis during the week, and do 'carb-ups' on the weekends. <br />� <br /> <font color="000099">Who can use the Ketogenic Diet?</font> <br /> <br />The ketogenic diet is used to treat intractable epilepsy in children. It may be prescribed when seizures are out of control, and when the side effects of anticonvulsant drugs and/or surgery are considered unacceptable.� It may effectively treat some cases of childhood myoclonic, absence and atonic seizures as well as tonic clonic seizures, multi focal seizures, and Lennox Gastaut Syndrome.� It has also been used to treat structural brain disorders such as microcephaly, hypoxic brain damage, prior strokes, and developmental abnormalities. <br /> <br />The ketogenic diet is usually directed at children one to eight years of age. Children below the age of one are not usually put on the diet as they may experience side effects, such as hypoglycemia. The diet has had some success with select older children and adolescents too. It is prescribed only when both the child and the family are highly motivated. The diet may be prescribed for two to three years. <br /> <br />It is said that adults may have problems maintaining essential nutrients, and therefore may not benefit from the diet, but in depth studies are rare and inconclusive. Many adults would not want to follow such a diet C most adults find it unpalatable C and find it very difficult to stick to it. <br />� <br /> <font color="000099">How does the Diet Work?</font> <br /> <br />To start the diet, children are admitted into the hospital, where they fast for two to three days. They receive only water, diet Kool-Aid, or diet Jell-O until tests for urine ketones are strongly positive, usually within 24 hours.� By doing this, all of the glucose (sugar) in the blood will be used up for energy. The ketogenic diet works by tricking the body into reacting as if it is starving or fasting: it causes the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates. When fats are burned in the absence of sugars, they do not burn completely. Instead, a residue of ketone bodies remains: the body is in a state of ketosis.� After the fasting period, children are started on a one-third fat shake then gradually introduced to the full diet. During the hospital stay, blood glucose levels and urinary ketone levels are monitored daily.� Parents are instructed in diet preparation and informed how to handle illness in children on the diet. They are also taught to read product labels to determine the carbohydrate content of various foods.� At discharge, parents receive information on how to handle children on the ketogenic diet in the classroom. <br /> <br />Despite the use of this diet in the treatment of seizure disorder since the 1920s and before, its exact mechanism is unknown. Research was largely discontinued when newer anti epileptic drugs became available in the 1940s. <br />� <br /> <font color="000099">Safety &amp; Side Effects</font> <br /> <br />The ketogenic diet is both safe and effective, with rare side effects only when it is not strictly followed. There is documentation of dehydration, constipation and a rare account of kidney stone formation, lowered immune functions, low blood sugar, and implication of increased serum lipid profile, which requires close monitoring. During the initial fast, your child's blood sugar level should be checked every four to six hours. The level often falls, which may lead to hypoglycemia. <br /> <br /> <b>The ketogenic diet must be supervised by qualified specialists.</b> <br />� <br /> <font color="000099">Is the Diet Nutritionally Complete?</font> <br /> <br />Dietary supplements, such as multivitamins and calcium, must be taken. These must be given in sugar free form. <br />� <br /> <font color="000099">Living with the Diet</font> <br /> <br />After consultation, if you opt for the diet, you may be asked to participate in a trial period. Also, there may be several days of training time when you will be given a diet designed specifically for your child. Everything your child consumes must be weighed and accounted for in the diet. The child may feel hungry during the first week or two. However, ketosis decreases the appetite. Some children on the ketogenic diet will feel very thirsty. Some parents give their children a regular dose of water or caffeine free diet soda every one or two hours during the day. Always consult your child's pediatrician or neurologist about the specifics of the ketogenic diet in your case. <br />� <br /> <font color="000099">Success</font> <br /> <br />�When rigidly adhered to, the ketogenic diet may successfully control epilepsy in 30-50% of children with intractable seizures. Many others will experience a marked decrease in seizure frequency. A child on the diet usually continues taking anti-epileptic medicine, but may be able to take less of it later on.� Many will be able to return to a normal diet within two to three years, free of seizures or medication. Most people investigate this diet as a last resort. The diet can be unpalatable and demands a great commitment from the entire family for a considerable period of time. Most people who make it past the first month will stick with the diet until they can return to a normal diet. <br />� <br /> <b>Sample Meal Plan:</b> <br /> <b>Breakfast:</b> <ul> <ul> <li>Scrambled eggs with butter </li> <li>Diluted cream </li> <li>Orange juice </li> </ul> </ul> <b><br />Lunch:</b> <ul> <ul> <li>Spaghetti squash with butter and Parmesan cheese </li> <li>Lettuce leaf with mayonnaise </li> <li>Orange diet soda mixed with whipped cream </li> </ul> </ul> <b><br />Dinner:</b> <ul> <ul> <li>Hot dog slices with sugar-free catsup </li> <li>Asparagus with butter </li> <li>Chopped lettuce with mayonnaise </li> <li>Sugar-free vanilla cream popsicle </li> </ul> </ul> <b><br />These examples do not show the exact amounts for each food because those have to be worked out for each child by the dietician.</b> <br />� <br /> <font color="000099">Where is the Diet Administered?</font> <br /> <br />In Ontario, the ketogenic diet is administered at the larger children's hospitals and several clinics.� Some hospitals and clinics are now considering the implementation of the ketogenic diet for adults. <br />The following centres (neurology departments) in Canada are able to start children on the diet: IWK Hospital for Children, Halifax, NS; Hospital Sainte -Justine, Montreal, QC; Montreal Children's Hospital, Montreal, QC; Bloorview-MacMillan Centre, No. York, Toronto, ON; Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, ON; BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC. <br /> <b>Parents and others are warned against trying to institute any part of the diet on their own.� The ketogenic diet is a complex medical treatment therapy that requires close supervision by a physician.</b> <br />� <br /> <font color="000099">Medium-Chain Triglyceride (MCT) Diet</font> <br /> <br />An alternative to the &quot;classic&quot; ketogenic diet is the MCT (medium-chain triglyceride) diet, which involves the use of a special oil to attain ketosis.� Although this diet is less unsettling and more flexible than the ketogenic diet, it is generally not as effective and less well tolerated. <br />� <br />� </div></td> <td align="right" valign="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="100%" rowspan="2" style="padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px"><a href="/client/eo/eoweb.nsf/PrinterFriendly/Ketogenic+Diet+(alt.+&amp;+comp.+therapies)?OpenDocument"><img src="/client/EO/EOObjects.nsf/object/Icons/$file/PrintBox.gif" border="0" alt="Printer Friendly" vspace="1" /></a><a href="https://www.epilepsyontario.org/client/EO/webmail.nsf/Direct+Donation"><img src="/client/EO/EOObjects.nsf/object/Nav/$file/Donate.gif" border="0" alt="We could really use your donation" vspace="1" /></a></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="bottom" class="Body" align="center"><br /><br /><a href="#ptop"><img src="/client/EO/EOObjects.nsf/object/Nav/$file/top.gif" border="0" /></a><br /><br /> <hr width="80%" color="lightgrey" noshade="" /><br /> <div> To submit questions, comments, or suggestions please click <a href="/client/EO/webmail.nsf/Comment?OpenForm">here</a>. <br /> <br /> <font color="lightgrey">Last Modified: 08/19/2010 11:48:31 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /></font> </div></td> </tr> </tbody> </table><br /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table></a> </div> <script type="text/javascript">var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?

A security measure, the security update identifies the copy of Windows Media Player with the computer on which Windows Media Player is being used. Record labels often require this sort of security in order to discourage the unlawful redistribution of digital content.</p><p>If you have not previously performed the security upgrade, the first time that you attempt to download DRM-protected content, OverDrive Media Console checks to see if you need to complete the security upgrade. If a security upgrade is needed, a message is displayed notifying you that in order to download and play DRM-protected content, you must first upgrade the security of your Windows Media Player.

In NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD), flight missions range from suborbital projects—including balloons, sounding rockets, and airplanes—to interplanetary probes and flagship observatories. All investigations and missions selected and flown must respond to Agency goals and strategic objectives. </p> <p> Mission opportunities are open to all proposers, within fixed rules, via public announcement, and selections are based primarily on scientific and technical merit as evaluated by independent peer review. Foreign partners are frequent and valued participants in joint missions. The partnerships are generally conducted on a cooperative, no-exchange-of-funds basis. NASA also works closely with a number of other Federal agencies to implement and support our flight missions. To learn more about mission planning and development, see section 3.3 of the <a href="/media/medialibrary/2010/03/31/Science_Plan_07.pdf" class="pdf">Science Plan for NASA's Science Mission Directorate 2007 - 2016 (PDF 5.1 MB</a>). </p> <p> This page provides access to all SMD missions, with several options for viewing.

It also contributes to the makeup of teeth and bones. Most important, it activates enzymes, contributes to energy production, and helps regulate calcium levels, as well as copper, zinc, potassium, vitamin D, and other important nutrients in the body.</p> <p>You can get magnesium from many foods. However, most people in the United States probably do not get as much magnesium as they should from their diet. Foods rich in magnesium include whole grains, nuts, and green vegetables. Green leafy vegetables are particularly good sources of magnesium.</p> <p>Although you may not get enough magnesium from your diet, it’s rare to be truly deficient in magnesium. Certain medical conditions, however, can upset the body's magnesium balance. For example, an intestinal virus that causes vomiting or diarrhea can cause temporary magnesium deficiencies. Some gastrointestinal diseases (such as irritable bowel syndrome or IBS and ulcerative colitis), diabetes, pancreatitis, hyperthyroidism (high thyroid hormone levels), kidney disease, and taking diuretics can lead to deficiencies. Too much coffee, soda, salt, or alcohol, as well as heavy menstrual periods, excessive sweating, and prolonged stress can also lower magnesium levels.</p> <p>Symptoms of magnesium deficiency may include agitation and anxiety, restless leg syndrome (RLS), sleep disorders, irritability, nausea and vomiting, abnormal heart rhythms, low blood pressure, confusion, muscle spasm and weakness, hyperventilation, insomnia, poor nail growth, and even seizures.</p> </div> <div class="section"> <h3 class="Uses">Uses</h3> <p>Getting enough magnesium may enhance the effectiveness of conventional treatment for the following conditions:</p> <p><strong>Asthma</strong></p> <p>Several studies show that intravenous (IV) magnesium and magnesium inhaled through a nebulizer can help treat acute attacks of asthma in children 6 - 18 years of age, as well as adults. But there is no evidence that taking oral magnesium helps control asthma symptoms. Low levels of magnesium may increase risk of developing asthma. A population based clinical study of more than 2,500 children 11 - 19 years of age found that low dietary magnesium intake may be associated with risk of asthma. The same was found in a group of more than 2,600 adults 18 - 70 years of age.</p> <p><strong>Depression</strong></p> <p>Inadequate magnesium appears to reduce serotonin levels, and antidepressants have been shown to raise brain magnesium. A 2008 study found that magnesium was as effective as the tricyclic antidepressants in treating depression among people with diabetes.</p> <p><strong>Diabetes</strong></p> <p>People who have type 2 diabetes often have low levels of magnesium in the blood. A large clinical study of over 2,000 people found that getting more magnesium in the diet may help protect against developing type 2 diabetes. Some -- though not all -- studies suggest that taking magnesium supplements may help blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity in people with diabetes or prediabetes.</p> <p><strong>Fibromyalgia</strong></p> <p>A small preliminary clinical study of 24 people with fibromyalgia found that a proprietary tablet containing both malic acid and magnesium improved pain and tenderness associated with fibromyalgia when taken for at least 2 months. Other studies suggest the combination of calcium and magnesium may be helpful for some people with fibromyalgia.</p> <p>However, a review article evaluating a number of studies found that magnesium with malic acid offered no pain relief. More studies are needed.</p> <p><strong>Noise related hearing loss</strong></p> <p>One study suggests that taking magnesium may prevent temporary or permanent hearing loss due to very loud noise.</p> <p><strong>Arrhythmia and heart failure</strong></p> <p>Magnesium is essential to heart health. Studies suggest a possible association between a modestly lower risk of CHD in men and increased magnesium intake. In one study of women, higher dietary intakes of magnesium were associated with a lower risk of sudden cardiac death. Magnesium helps maintain a normal heart rhythm and is sometimes given intravenously (IV) in the hospital to reduce the chance of atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). People with congestive heart failure (CHF) are often at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmia. For this reason, your doctor may decide that magnesium should be a part of the treatment of CHF. One well designed study found that taking magnesium orotate for a year reduced symptoms and improved survival rates compared to placebo in people with CHF. Magnesium and calcium work together at very precise ratios to ensure your heart functions properly. If you have a cardiac history, talk to your doctor before taking magnesium supplements.</p> <p>Results of studies using magnesium to treat heart attack survivors, however, have been mixed. Some have reported lower death rates, as well as fewer arrhythmias and improved blood pressure when magnesium is used as part of the treatment following a heart attack. But one study found that magnesium slightly increased the risk of sudden death, chance of another heart attack, or need for bypass surgery in the year after a heart attack. If you have had a heart attack, your doctor will decide if magnesium supplementation, either IV or orally, is right for you.</p> <p><strong>High blood pressure</strong></p> <p>Eating low fat dairy products, along with lots of fruits and vegetables on a regular basis, is associated with lower blood pressure. All of these foods are rich in magnesium, as well as calcium and potassium. A large clinical study of more than 8,500 women found that a higher intake of dietary magnesium may decrease the risk of high blood pressure in women. A few studies also suggest that magnesium supplements may help lower blood pressure, although not all studies agree.</p> <p><strong>Migraine headache</strong></p> <p>A few studies suggest that taking magnesium supplements may help prevent migraine headaches. In addition, a few clinical studies suggest that magnesium supplements may shorten the duration of a migraine and reduce the amount of medication needed. People who have migraine headaches tend to have lower levels of magnesium compared to those with tension headaches or no headaches at all.</p> <p>Some experts suggest combining magnesium with the herb feverfew along with vitamin B2 (riboflavin) may be helpful when you have a headache.</p> <p>However, some studies suggest that magnesium sulfate may be less effective than prescription medications for preventing migraines in those who have 3 or more headaches per month. The only exception to this may be women who get migraine headaches around the time of their period.</p> <p><strong>Osteoporosis</strong></p> <p>Not getting enough calcium, vitamin D, magnesium, and other micronutrients may play a role in the development of osteoporosis. To prevent osteoporosis, it is important to get enough calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D; to eat a well balanced diet; and to do weight bearing exercises throughout life.</p> <p><strong>Preeclampsia and eclampsia</strong></p> <p>Preeclampsia is characterized by a sharp rise in blood pressure during the third trimester of pregnancy. Women with preeclampsia may develop seizures, which is then called eclampsia. Magnesium, given in the hospital intravenously (IV), is the treatment of choice to prevent or treat seizures associated with eclampsia or to prevent complications from preeclampsia.</p> <p><strong>Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)</strong></p> <p>Scientific studies suggest that magnesium supplements may help relieve symptoms associated with PMS, particularly bloating, insomnia, leg swelling, weight gain, and breast tenderness. One study suggests that a combination of magnesium and vitamin B6 may work better than either one alone.</p> <p><strong>Restless legs syndrome</strong></p> <p>A small clinical study including only 10 patients found that magnesium improved insomnia related to restless legs syndrome (a disorder characterized by uncomfortable sensations in the legs, which are worse during periods of inactivity or rest or while sitting or lying down).</p> </div> <div class="section"> <h3 class="Dietary Sources">Dietary Sources</h3> <p>Rich sources of magnesium include tofu, legumes, whole grains, green leafy vegetables, wheat bran, Brazil nuts, soybean flour, almonds, cashews, blackstrap molasses, pumpkin and squash seeds, pine nuts, and black walnuts. Other good dietary sources of this mineral include peanuts, whole wheat flour, oat flour, beet greens, spinach, pistachio nuts, shredded wheat, bran cereals, oatmeal, bananas, and baked potatoes (with skin), chocolate, and cocoa powder. Many herbs, spices, and seaweeds supply magnesium, such as agar seaweed, coriander, dill weed, celery seed, sage, dried mustard, basil, cocoa powder, fennel seed, savory, cumin seed, tarragon, marjoram, poppy seed.</p> </div> <div class="section"> <h3 class="Available Forms">Available Forms</h3> <p>Magnesium is available in many forms. Recommended types include magnesium citrate, magnesium gluconate, and magnesium lactate, all of which are more easily absorbed into the body than other forms. Time release preparations may improve absorption. Ask your health care provider.</p> <p>Other familiar sources are magnesium hydroxide (often used as a laxative or antacid) and magnesium sulfate (generally used orally as a laxative or in multivitamins, or added to a bath). Some magnesium can be absorbed through the skin.</p> </div> <div class="section"> <h3 class="How to Take It">How to Take It</h3> <p>Be sure to check with your health care provider before taking magnesium supplements and before considering them for a child. Under certain circumstances, such as certain heart arrhythmias or preeclampsia, a doctor will give magnesium intravenously (IV) in the hospital.</p> <p>It is a good idea to take a B vitamin complex, or a multivitamin containing B vitamins, because the level of vitamin B6 in the body determines how much magnesium will be absorbed into the cells.</p> <p>Dosages are based on the dietary reference intakes (DRIs) issued from the Food and Nutrition Board of the United States Government's Office of Dietary Supplements, part of the National Institutes of Health.</p> <p><b>Pediatric</b></p> <p>Do not give magnesium supplements to a child without a doctor’s supervision.</p> <ul> <li>Children 1 - 3 years of age: 40 - 80 mg daily</li> <li>Children 4 - 8 years of age: 130 mg daily</li> <li>Children 9 - 13 years of age: 240 mg daily</li> <li>Males 14 - 18 years of age: 410 mg daily</li> <li>Females 14 - 18 years of age: 360 mg daily</li> <li>Pregnant females 14 - 18 years of age: 400 mg daily</li> <li>Breastfeeding females 14 - 18 years of age: 360 mg daily</li> </ul> <p><b>Adult</b></p> <ul> <li>Males 19 - 30 years of age: 400 mg daily</li> <li>Females 19 - 30 years of age: 310 mg daily</li> <li>Males 31 years of age and over: 420 mg daily</li> <li>Females 31 years of age and over: 320 mg daily</li> <li>Pregnant females 19 - 30 years of age: 350 mg daily</li> <li>Pregnant females 31 and over: 360 mg daily</li> <li>Breastfeeding females 19 - 30 years of age: 310 mg daily</li> <li>Breastfeeding females 31 years of age and over: 320 mg daily</li> </ul> <p>A person’s need for magnesium increases during pregnancy, recovery from surgery and illnesses, and athletic training. Speak with your physician.</p> </div> <div class="section"> <h3 class="Precautions">Precautions</h3> <p>Because of the potential for side effects and interactions with medications, dietary supplements should be taken only under the supervision of a knowledgeable health care provider.</p> <p>Since magnesium is excreted by the kidneys, people with heart or kidney disease should not take magnesium supplements except under their doctor's supervision.</p> <p>It is very rare to overdose on magnesium from food. However, people who ingest large amounts of milk of magnesia (as a laxative or antacid), epsom salts (as a laxative or tonic), or magnesium supplements may overdose, especially if they have kidney problems. Too much magnesium can cause serious health problems, including nausea, vomiting, severely lowered blood pressure, confusion, slowed heart rate, respiratory paralysis, deficiencies of other minerals, coma, cardiac arrhythmias, cariac arrest, and death.</p> <p>More common side effects from magnesium include upset stomach and diarrhea.</p> <p>Magnesium competes with calcium for absorption and can cause a calcium deficiency if calcium levels are already low. Some medications may lower magnesium levels in the body. These include chemotherapy drugs, diuretics, digoxin (Lanoxin), steroids, and certain antibiotics.</p> </div> <div class="section"> <h3 class="Possible Interactions">Possible Interactions</h3> <p>If you are currently being treated with any of the following medications, you should not use magnesium without first talking to your health care provider.</p> <p><strong>Aminoglycosides</strong> -- Concomitant use with magnesium may cause neuromuscular weakness and paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Antibiotics</strong> -- Taking magnesium supplements may reduce the absorption of quinolone antibiotics, tetracycline antibiotics, and nitrofurantoin (Macrodandin). Magnesium should be taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after taking these medications. Quinolone and tetracycline antibiotics include:</p> <ul> <li>Ciprofloxacin (Cipro)</li> <li>Moxifloxacin (Avelox)</li> <li>Tetracycline (Sumycin)</li> <li>Doxycycline (Vibramycin)</li> <li>Minocycline (Minocin)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Blood Pressure Medications, Calcium Channel Blockers</strong> -- Magnesium may increase the risk of negative side effects (such as dizziness, nausea, and fluid retention) from calcium channel blockers (particularly nifedipine or Procardia) in pregnant women. Other calcium channel blockers include:</p> <ul> <li>Aamlodipine (Norvasc)</li> <li>Diltiazem (Cardizem)</li> <li>Felodipine (Plendil)</li> <li>Verapamil (Calan)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Medications for diabetes</strong> -- Magnesium hydroxide, commonly found in antacids such as Alternagel, may increase the absorption of some medications used to control blood sugar levels (particularly glipizide or Glucatrol and glyburide or Micronase). If you take these medications to control blood sugar, your doctor may need to adjust your dose.</p> <p><strong>Digoxin (Lanoxin)</strong> -- Low blood levels of magnesium can increase negative effects from digoxin, including heart palpitations and nausea. In addition, digoxin can cause more magnesium to be lost in the urine. A doctor will monitor magnesium levels in people taking digoxin to see whether they need a magnesium supplement.</p> <p><strong>Diuretics</strong> -- Diuretics known as loop (such as furosemide or Lasix) and thiazide (including hydrochlorothiazide) can lower magnesium levels. For this reason, doctors who prescribe diuretics may recommend magnesium supplements as well.</p> <p><strong>Fluoroquinones</strong> -- Concomitant use with magnesium may decrease absorption and effectiveness. Flouroquinones should be taken a minimum of 4 hours before any products containing magnesium.</p> <p><strong>Hormone Replacement Therapy</strong> -- Magnesium levels tend to decrease during menopause. Clinical studies suggest, however, that hormone replacement therapy may help prevent the loss of this mineral. Postmenopausal women, or those taking hormone replacement therapy, should talk with a health care provider about the risks and benefits of magnesium supplementation.</p> <p><strong>Labetol</strong> -- Concomitant use with magneisum can slow heart beat abnormally and reduce cardiac output.</p> <p><strong>Levomethadyl</strong> -- Concomitant use with magnesium may precipitate a heart condition called QT prolongation.</p> <p><strong>Levothyroxine</strong> -- There have been case reports of magnesium containing antacids reducing the effectiveness of levothyroxine, a medication that treats underactive thyroid.</p> <p><strong>Penicillamine</strong> -- Penicillamine, a medication used to treat Wilson's disease (a condition characterized by high levels of copper in the body) and rheumatoid arthritis, can inactivate magnesium, particularly when high doses of the drug are used over a long period of time. Supplementation with magnesium and other nutrients may reduce side effects associated with penicillamine. If you take penicillamine, a health care provider can determine whether magnesium supplements are right for you.</p> <p><strong>Tiludronate (Skelid) and Alendronate (Fosamax)</strong> -- Magnesium may interfere with absorption of medications used in osteoporosis, including alendronate (Fosamax). Magnesium or antacids containing magnesium should be taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after taking these medications.</p> <p><strong>Others</strong> -- Aminoglycoside antibiotics (such as gentamicin and tobramycin), thiazide diuretics (such as hydrochlorothiazide), loop diuretics (such as furosemide and bumetanide), amphotericin B, corticosteroids (prednisone or Deltasone), antacids, and insulin may lower magnesium levels. Please refer to the depletions monographs on some of these medications for more information.</p> </div> <div class="section"> <h3 class="Supporting Research">Supporting Research</h3> <p>Aydin H, Deyneli O, Yavuz D, G&ouml;z&uuml; H, Mutlu N, Kaygusuz I, Akalin S.

Did trek out this morning for about 30 minutes and found roughly 2 dozen that had been about a week over due. They were large yellows, most had bites taken out of them or drying up. They were all in the same area all growing under the same conditions.</p> <p>Cedar Trees bordering large hardwoods with a mixture of Tulip and Oaks. All of the Morels were found within the first 10 feet of the Cedars and about 90% of them were within 3 feet of a cedar tree trunk. I found none next to the Tulips and none next to my favorite trees (Willow Oaks).</p> <p>I’m going to stop at another local spot on my way home from the office to see if there is anything in this area. The area has a large stream with Cedars and Tulips. They are always growing in the same location which is on the high side of the stream within 20′ of the cedar grove. Although there are lots of large Tulips growing throughout the area, the morels never seem to grow next to them, but adjacent to them but within the Cedars or cedar clearings.</p> <p>One problem I see this year over previous seasons is the undergrowth. It is very dense and I am sure lots are being missed due to viability issues with all the vegetation growing on the forest floor this year.</p> <p>If your not finding them, slow down… way down! Also look in areas that have less undergrowth but still support Morels… Cedar Groves bordered by old hardwoods (must have Tulips and Oak) are great spots. And the cedar groves will definitely have less undergrowth in them over the rest of the forest.</p> <p>If anyone lives in the Fairfax (Centerville) area and needs a place to practice finding them. I have a location you can hunt (and will find them), however you can not pick them (protected area), but a really great place to practice your technique and get some confidence.</p> <p>Leave your email address and I will email you the location.</p> <p>Good luck everyone.</p> <br clear="all" /> </div> </li> <li class="alt" id="comment-73511"> <strong>Chris</strong> on April 26th, 2012 12:04 pm <div class="commenttext"> <p>Guys I need some assistance.

Most of the people posting here seem to be located in the north and west of me.</p> <br clear="all" /> </div> </li> <li class="alt" id="comment-73332"> <strong>Becky</strong> on April 26th, 2012 7:06 am <div class="commenttext"> <p>Sara, curious, what are flat tops? What are imitation black trumpets? Since I last wrote, I found one lone Morel that had been sitting for weeks at a really high elevation. I found most of mine between March 23rd and April 8th this year. Though this SHOULD be peak week for VA, I think the peak was 3 weeks ago and now we have to hunt for fresh fruiting in REALLY high elevations (3000FT +) that didn’t fruit a month ago. I have a friend who thinks that the same spot could fruit and then pause and fruit again 3 weeks later, but I can’t imagine that. I am encouraged by the fact that someone found 200 in Giles last weekend and that the person here in Bath Co. is finding big yellows. I am still hunting and Big Stoney Creek looked good last night but I ran out of time and didn’t find anything. Bad part is, the high elevation spots take a long time to drive to <img src="http://www.morels.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> </p> <br clear="all" /> </div> </li> <li class="" id="comment-73328"> <strong>Becky</strong> on April 26th, 2012 6:59 am <div class="commenttext"> <p>Matthew, there is no collection allowed in State Parks, the Blue Ridge Parkway (National Park Service)and National Recreation Areas has “bag limits” per person/per day, the National Forest allows personal collection as long as you aren’t in a “developed recreational area” and wilderness areas have separate rules. State Wildlife Preserves (DGIF) require use permits. State Forest is OK, as far as I know. Nature Conservancy Preserves don’t allow collection. Nichole is right however, in that some people will say different things when you ask because they don’t necessarily know the rules. Most rules in VA deal with hunting ANIMALS and some people don’t realize that there is anything else to hunt.</p> <br clear="all" /> </div> </li> <li class="alt" id="comment-73320"> <strong>Bert</strong> on April 26th, 2012 6:24 am <div class="commenttext"> <p>Nichole…must just be a bad year in my spots, because I know they havent come up and we’re talking about spots that I have picked hundreds of pounds of mushrooms in one year.

My buddy found 214, but he got there earlier. They were VERY hard to find and VERY specific as to that weekend’s pattern of where they were. But once we figured out the pattern, we loaded up. (More than half the hunt was spent identifying the pattern; we don’t just go for a walk in the woods, nor do we rely on historic spots: we hunt ‘em like pro bass fishermen, eliminating and zeroing in.)</p> <p>You are closer to me than my 10-12 spots (I now live in the Northern Neck), and as such I would be more than willing to trade my experience in finding them for access to land that is closer.</p> <p>So get in touch with me, please.

The second thing is that what we find in the name of Morels, the way we stumble on them and sometimes for the first time, is as exciting as finding the darn Morels. The hunt today yielded a find of a patch of two Jack in the Pulpit “Arisaema triphyllum” with purple spadix and whitish green lower half as found against vertical creek side wall…just thrilling. The Mayapples still flowering and its fruiting started to materialize, with an accidental bump caused the creamy white petals to drop. The tulip poplar flowers are strewn on the floor surounding the tulip tree, it looks like some critters are as interested in eating them and droping them as we are to the Morels…or I would rather say, more like those who are lucky to harvest them. So on a rainy day like this, thanks for the criters for the droppings, you do not have to look up to identify the leaves if the barck is not giving the tree away.<br />In summary: none found and it is now nice and wet and only the coming two weeks will tell.</p> <br clear="all" /> </div> </li> <li class="alt" id="comment-71108"> <strong>Nichole</strong> on April 22nd, 2012 7:11 pm <div class="commenttext"> <p>Matthew for all I can find out there are no rules.

The trees, the rain, the temperature and the orientation of your slopes including the drainage and the soil type yet nothing. I’m giving it till the end of next week with the promised rain and the low temperatures and if none found I’m claiming the area a test bed to segregate the top host for the Morel mycelium:<br />- Is it the Tulip Tree cluster by the creek?<br />- Is it the Tulip tree cluster on the flat bed beside the creek?<br />- Is it the Tulip tree cluster on the steep slope from the creek?<br />- Is it the overall elevation where this terrain is, a 480 to 520 feet from sea level?<br />- Is it the mayapples field under the poplar, or<br />o the mix of mayapples and ground Cedar, or<br /> Mayapples with Fiddleheads under Tulip poplar, or<br />• Is it White Pine with a mix of Tulip poplar …<br />At this time I’m hoping that I find none this season as well as the next few seasons to make sure that the area never been exposed to the Morel spores…is this possible..Never ever!!

First off, this is definately not a great year in most places, the timing has been off. look for spots that still are holding moisture in poplar groves, always try to look going uphill. always check where lots of rotting branches/ wild grapevine are laying in piles.get off the beaten path in heavily hunted areas. people don’t like to crawl through thickets, and a lot of times that’s where you’ll find a good mess. When you spot one, STOP! crouch down and often you will find several.Don’t beat a dead horse, if you’re not finding anything in a paticular spot, move on to another. several of my good spots have been pitiful this year. look for saddles and gulleys near good host trees, debris and morel spore tend to collect there. ANd finally, when you know conditions are right for blonds to be up, learn what elm trees are and how to spot them. once you know how to spot them, pay close attention to its condition I’ve always found the best honey holes around trees in the initial stages of dying. It will have few, or no buds on it, and the bark may be starting to slip. their bases are somewhat palmated so you can follow the roots.happy hunting!</p> <br clear="all" /> </div> </li> <li class="" id="comment-66071"> <strong>Brigham</strong> on April 15th, 2012 11:00 am <div class="commenttext"> <p>I have been hunting in Fauquier and can’t even find one.

Morels and pan fish dinner. I didn’t know you could find them here and I tried last year around Burke lake just to get my feet wet and that’s about all I got. I am hoping for some results this year and some of these post help, I know how secret spots can be, but they are spors and do travel and if picked right more will show so secret isn’t always the best but understandable. I will say that the one’s who pick them are pretty dedicated and the one’s that don’t aren’t to much trouble so sharing a little doesn’t hurt.

Any way drove north 3 miles and parked took the Appalachian trail south for 4 miles one way (off coarse off the trail here and there)…Guys it is bare up there on 3/30/2012, yes quite few Tulip Poplars, huge but mostly not all in green yet , the leaves were still the size of a Dime (about what I have seen in Ruckersville a week ago)…So you can hear me say the obvious…Low to high elevation is the season for Morels….and everything else. Drove south on the Skyline drive, about 3 miles below the exit to Waynesboro, nice ride, bigger leaves…some Poplars …called it a day..None found except two ticks…Be careful out there, the ticks are out too.</p> <br clear="all" /> </div> </li> <li class="alt" id="comment-55607"> <strong>John F Castagnola</strong> on April 1st, 2012 8:47 pm <div class="commenttext"> <p>Just ate a dozen or so picked at different times last week from our yard in Orange County Virginia</p> <br clear="all" /> </div> </li> <li class="" id="comment-55541"> <strong>Claes</strong> on April 1st, 2012 7:50 pm <div class="commenttext"> <p>Alison, I’m no expert, only in my third year.

Boil Chicken breast until cooked, remove from heat, cool and shred into pieces<br />2. In skillet saut&eacute; leek or onions, carrots and garlic in 1 tablespoon of butter<br />3. In a large pot over medium heat, combine broth, water, leeks (or onions), carrots, garlic, celery and chicken. Bring just to boiling, and then stir in rice (reserving seasoning packet). Cover and remove from heat.<br />4. In a small bowl, combine salt, pepper and flour.<br />5. In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt 1/2 cup of butter. Stir in contents of seasoning packet until mixture is bubbly (stir constantly). Reduce heat to low, and then stir in flour mixture by tablespoons, to form a roux stirring constantly (will be very thick).<br />6. Wisk in cream to roux mixture a little at a time until fully incorporated and smooth. Add in your Morels and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes.<br />7. Stir morel mixture into your pot of broth, rice and vegetables mixture.<br />8. Simmer over medium heat until heated through, about 30 minutes stirring occasionally to keep smooth and to not let boil or burn to bottom of pot.<br />9.

Finally a very generous avid young Morel hunter took me in and he would stop and stand next to a patch and I remember starring at it for few minutes and I could not see the three clusters…the morels went horizontal while I was looking for a clear vertical specimen. It was very gratifying experience to get the eye trained and very definitely memorable. So this is my first year in search for the elusive Morels on my own. …Simply said, Greene and surrounding counties offer quite a delicious prize mushrooms we need to be aware of and as I mentioned earlier, I’m hoping to spot Morels this season…I’m counting on shedding few pounds in the process..Wish me luck.</p> <br clear="all" /> </div> </li> <li class="alt" id="comment-51972"> <strong>Shroomometer</strong> on March 28th, 2012 5:30 pm <div class="commenttext"> <p>Warren County, VA.

Here’s the news: The hot weather has definitely accelerated morels as much as it has tree blossoms. I found large, spent blacks very near emerging whites and grays. Found fresh blacks on cooler side of ridge with several half frees mixed in.<br />To set the record straight: I have never, ever found large whites in this area before April 5th in 20 years of harvesting morels.

The tulip tree or Tulip Poplar is not a true poplar. It is called a “poplar” because of its light wood. These trees are one of the most abundant trees in the area. They grow extremely fast and straight up. The leaves of this tree are large and look like a t-shirt when flipped upside down. They also have singular large orange/yellow flowers. The young trees bark resemble the skin of a canteloupe.<br />Now the true poplars are somewhat hard to find in the wild. These have been timbered for many years and most of the ones you find now are man planted. Anyways, I have found Morels at the base of Tulip Poplar trees.

I should have checked what some books interpreted before spilling it as is. A book on Morels that I’m reading “MORELS” by Michael Kuo, refers that the Tulip tree “Liriodendron tulipifera” should not be confused with Tulip Poplar, what they really meant Liriodendron is not closely related to the true poplars of the genus Populus. The author Michael Kuo and his statement means just the Latter, in other words Tulip tree or commonly known as Tulip Poplar, or Yellow Poplar is not of the genus Populus. Thank you for questioning. With last night rain and this ideal climate temperature, and after 3.5 hrs scouring the right places, I accounted for a very dense Tulip tree patches, took lots of pictures of the trunks facing North as well as South…as well as shot of the perfect bare cone top….. few are in their initial blooming stages.<br /> Bottom line, no Morels found on such a wet cool morning of 3/25/12 in Ruckersville, VA.</p> <br clear="all" /> </div> </li> <li class="alt" id="comment-48774"> <strong>Nick</strong> on March 25th, 2012 4:01 pm <div class="commenttext"> <p>Just spent 2 hours in Potomac, VA Great Falls side and nada…nothing.

I have one small spot at about 1,250′ that I walk to from my farm but it is only good early and for blacks…only found one grey there in 12 years of hunting, but a bunch of blacks early on. After the first two weeks of the season, the hike is on here if you want to get into anything worth finding…stay above 2,000′ after the 3rd week in April and you might luck upon some late blacks and fresh yellows. I can’t stand it anymore so I’m heading to the spot above my farm in the morning…I will post any findings.

That vine seems to be taking over what would have probably been very good<br />morel spots. Take this advice though, try to look along<br />the edges of woods or meadows or along fences or railroad<br />tracks.

An AVF can allow high-pressure arterial blood to flow directly into veins. When high-pressure arterial blood flows into veins, it can cause them to bulge or burst (hemorrhage). In addition, arterial blood that is shunted directly to veins leaves tissues deprived of blood and oxygen.<br /><br />AVFs can occur anywhere in the body, but those that cause neurological symptoms occur in the brain and spine. AVFs that occur in the brain include: <ul> <li>Dural AVFs;</li> <li>Direct carotid-cavernous fistula; and</li> <li>Indirect carotid-cavernous fistula.</li> </ul><strong>WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?</strong><br /><br />AVF symptoms can vary depending on its location and severity. Symptoms associated with cerebral AVFs include: <ul> <li>Roaring sound in the ears caused by the turbulent blood flow (tinnitus);</li> <li>Headache;</li> <li>Seizure; and</li> <li>Hemorrhage into the brain.</li> </ul>Symptoms of carotid cavernous AVFs may include swelling and redness in and around the eye and vision problems.<br /><br />Symptoms of spinal AVFs include: <ul> <li>Progressive weakness in the legs;</li> <li>Trouble walking;</li> <li>Sexual dysfunction;</li> <li>Paralysis; and</li> <li>Bowel and bladder difficulties.</li> </ul><strong>CAUSES AND RISK FACTORS</strong><br /><br />AVFs can be congenital, meaning the AVF has been present from birth. Most, however, are acquired and spontaneous and their cause is unknown (idiopathic).<br /><br />Causes of acquired AVFs include: <ul> <li>Trauma, such as a blow to the head or spine;</li> <li>Complications of cranial surgery;</li> <li>Blood clots in the affected vessels;</li> <li>Infection; and</li> <li>Tumors.</li> </ul><strong>DIAGNOSIS</strong><br /><br />Tests used to diagnose AVFs include: <ul> <li>Angiography;</li> <li>Myelography;</li> <li>Computed tomography (CT) scan;</li> <li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); and</li> <li>Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).</li> </ul><strong>TREATMENT APPROACH</strong><br /><br />The goal of AVF treatment is to close the abnormal connection between artery and vein to prevent hemorrhage and relieve pressure on the brain or spinal cord. The following techniques may be used: <ul> <li>Manual compression of the carotid artery;</li> <li>Endovascular embolization;</li> <li>Open surgery; and</li> <li>Radiosurgery.</li> </ul> </span> </div> <div id="med_review" style="padding:0px 0px 10px 0px"> <span class="article" style="font-size:9px">Medical Review Date: September 29, 2008</span> </div> <div id="plc_disclaimer" style="padding:0px 0px 10px 0px"> <span class="article" style="font-size:9px"><sup>*</sup>If you would like to read this article in its entirety, please call our office and ask to meet with one of our specialists to receive a Prescription Pad form.<br /><br /><sup>*</sup>If you already have a Prescription Pad form, please login and follow the instructions listed on the form.

It is no different when it comes to growing hair back, and my recommendation of the best way to get started is the covered in the <a title="Total Hair Regrowth" href=" http://www.hairlossbalding.net/go/total-hair-regrowth/"><strong>Total Hair Regrowth guide</strong></a>.</p> <p></p> <h1>Hair Loss Balding – The Factors</h1> <p>There are so many factors that can lead to hair loss and balding, it can be quite overwhelming when you begin your research. While female and male pattern baldness, or androgenic alopecia, is the most common cause for losing hair, the issue baldness can be related to many different types of causes. Typically in women, damage from too much perming, excessive coloring, or bleaching will cause women to lose hair. In both men and women, there are some other, general culprits for thinning hair that will lead to baldness or even just patchy balding. To list just a few, they include:<br /></p> <ul> <li>Auto-immune diseases</li> <li>Hormonal changes (mainly in women, but steroids or testosterone irregularities are known to cause men to lose hair)</li> <li>Parasites</li> <li>Severe emotional or mental stress</li> <li>Seborrhea</li> <li>Traction alopecia</li> <li>Poor nutritional diet</li> <li>Dehydration</li> <li>Medical side-effects (not limited to chemotherapy)</li> <li>Genetics</li> </ul> <p>Identifying the root cause of why you lose hair as an individual is a vital first step to solving your hair loss. Rather than cope with your baldness, there are things you can do to grow hair back.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong><p></p></strong> <blockquote> <strong><p><b>“</b>Hair Loss Balding, Can I Improve My Hair Health and Grow Hair Back?<b>“</b></p></strong> </blockquote></h2> <p>Yes! Baldness is a topic that many doctors use to promote expensive treatments or surgery. However, Hair Loss Balding is here to help. If you really want to deal with your balding problem, you will need to dig deep and learn more about the why hair loss occurs and the various ways that you can use to deal with the problem.

Certainly you are waiting to have the answers to “how can I grow hair back?”</p> <p>The solutions for balding can range from the most rudimentary to the cutting-edge, technologically advanced procedures. Hair transplants, lasers, steroidal injections, Propecia, Minoxidil, Finasteride, etc. are just a few examples. You might already be familiar with some of these products or methods because you might have already tried one or two of them.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a skin disorder due to a microorganism and consists of an inflammation of the skin. Symptoms include excessive and increased dandruff that is usually thick and oily. Seborrhoeic dermatitis affects the torso and forehead, but on the scalp it is a common cause for baldness. Often seborrheic dermatitis becomes visible with flaky, scaly, red, and itchy skin. It specifically affects the sebaceous-gland-rich areas of skin; hence the name seborrhea. If outbreaks are left untreated for extended periods of time, hair loss and balding may become permanent due to damage inflicted on the hair follicles (also making it more difficult to grow hair back). </p> <p></p> <h1>Grow Hair Back – Avoid Baldness</h1> <p>Seborrhea can appear as a thick film, covering the back of the neck, forehead, and of course the scalp. Natural products such as vegetable oil and olive oil (but also Vaseline) may be used to remove the film regularly, and the scalp should be treated with ointments consisting of ammoniated mercury (4%). Ammoniated mercury is available over-the-counter and is often used for other skin diseases (i.e. Psoriasis). Firstly you want to get rid of the Seborrhea, stop it from returning, and then you can begin to grow hair back.</p> <p>Every four to five weeks, shampoos with tar soap suds should be used, and avoid getting the hair wet between shampoo application intervals. <strong>Gently</strong> combing or brushing the hair daily is also recommended to stimulate the scalp and remove dirt and oil. The brush is also used to improve surface of the hair follicles. However, rigorous and redundant brushing does damage and is unnecessary. Washing the hair to often will also have a detrimental effect and cause increased hair loss or balding.</p> </div> <!-- .entry-content --> <footer class="entry-meta"> <span class="cat-links"> Posted in <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hairloss,balding/hair-loss-balding-information/" title="View all posts in Hair Loss Balding Information" rel="category tag">Hair Loss Balding Information</a>, <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hairloss,balding/seborrhea/" title="View all posts in Seborrhea" rel="category tag">Seborrhea</a><br /> </span> <span class="tag-links"> Tagged <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hairloss,balding/balding/" rel="tag">balding</a>, <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hairloss,balding/hair-loss/" rel="tag">hair loss</a>, <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hairloss,balding/hair-loss-balding/" rel="tag">hair loss balding</a>, <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hairloss,balding/seborrhea/" rel="tag">Seborrhea</a><br /> </span> <span class="comments-link"><a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hair-loss-balding-scalp-seborrhea/#respond" rel="nofollow" title="Comment on The Scalp – Seborrhea Causes Balding">Leave a comment</a></span> <br /> </footer> <!-- #entry-meta --> </article> <!-- #post-161 --> <article id="post-129" class="post-129 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-balding-and-hair-loss-treatments category-stop-baldness-secrets tag-hair-loss-balding"> <header class="entry-header"> <div class="entry-meta"> <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hair-loss-balding-secrets/" title="3:18 am" rel="bookmark"><time class="entry-date" datetime="2012-03-14T03:18:44+00:00" pubdate="">March 14, 2012</time></a> <span class="byline"> <span class="sep"> by </span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/author/admin/" title="View all posts by admin" rel="author">admin</a></span></span> </div> <!-- .entry-meta --> <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hair-loss-balding-secrets/" title="Permalink to Hair Loss and Balding Secrets?" rel="bookmark">Hair Loss and Balding Secrets?</a></h1> </header> <!-- .entry-header --> <div class="entry-content"> <p></p> <h1>Forget Hair in a Can For Hair Loss or Balding</h1> <p>Hair loss is a common problem for both male and female. Although baldness or excessive hair fall is a not a disease, it can be a indication of an underlying problem. Hair Loss Balding always recommends it is a good idea to check with a doctor first. However, shedding which causes baldness can be due to several other reasons, namely the type of products used, the water, the environment, stress and so on.</p> <p><b>Recently, a hair transplant doctor admitted a secret to Hair Loss Balding which he really did not want repeated</b>. He admitted that hair transplant procedures were now not the only method of restoration, but the secret was that the <a href=" http://www.hairlossbalding.net/go/total-hair-regrowth/" "title"="" "total="" hair="" regrowth"="">Total Hair Regrowth</a> plan was the most affordable, natural, and effective way to stop balding, cure your hair loss, and start regrowing a full head of hair all in the comforts of your own home. Hair Loss Balding believes this to be one of the most effective alternatives to hair transplant surgery.</p> <p></p> <h1>Free Hair Loss Balding Tips</h1> <p>In order to stop hair loss, we need to go the root of the problem. If it is because of an illness, then that needs to be taken care of; if it is due to other reasons mentioned above then we need to find a solution. In any case, we need to take care of hair heath in the same way we need to take care of our bodies. </p> <p>Some of the ways to stop balding and increase hair growth are:</p> <ul> <li>If there is major shedding then it could be an indication of deficiency of some essential nutrients in the body. Hair Loss Balding recommends you thoroughly examine your diet and nutrition regimen. Plan a well-balanced meal and take multivitamins to put back the lacking nutrients back in the body. Vitamins A, B and E are good for the hair.</li> <li>Drink plenty of water. Water flushes out toxins from the body and also keeps you hydrated. Make sure the water you drink is distilled or filtered, and avoid water containing chlorine or other chemicals.</li> <li>Avoid caffeine. This causes the body to dehydrate which is not good for the hair. Instead try fruit juices.</li> <li>Know what you put on your hair. Oil your it on weekly basis. Apply coconut oil once a week. Warm the oil a little before applying. Leave it one for an hour before washing it off.</li> <li>Avoid shampoos that have three in one substances in them. Do not shampoo every day. Twice a week is enough.</li> <li>Avoid pulling your hair back tightly.</li> <li>Make sure the pillow you sleep on has cotton covers that do not pull your hair out.</li> <li>Avoid smoking and alcohol.</li> <li>Do not brush or comb when wet.</li> <li>After a shower, dry the hair by patting with the towel rather than rubbing with it</li> </ul> <p></p> <h1>Take Action Soon To Avoid Hair Loss and Balding</h1> <p>The above Hair Loss Balding tips will help to reduce balding and promote new growth. It is natural to lose about forty to fifty strands of hair a day, so do not be alarmed at this. Taking care of the hair in a proper manner will promote new growth.

Some revolutionary and extremely effective at-home treatments can be found by <a href=" http://www.hairlossbalding.net/go/total-hair-regrowth/" title="grow more hair">clicking here</a>.</p> <h2>Minoxidil To Treat Hair Loss and Balding?</h2> <p>This was originally a blood pressure medication. It opens up the blood vessels and thus reduces the blood pressure.</p> <p>However, many men who took it found that their receding hairline stopped and they were also able to grow back hair on bald spots.</p> <p>Although other blood pressure medications don’t have the same effect, we can theorise that the opening of the blood vessels helps the hair follicles get back the nutrition that they have lost access to over the years which originally caused the baldness.</p> <p>It is available as a topical liquid or foam, usually in a 5% concentration, that is rubbed into the scalp.</p> <p>Common side effects are itchy scalp and dandruff. Rarely there can be allergic reactions. It is highly toxic to cats.</p> <h2>Cure Hair Loss and Balding with Finasteride?</h2> <p>Finasteride was originally created as a treatment for enlarged prostates and then for prostate cancer. It does this by eliminating a hormone byproduct called DHT that is implicated. However, DHT is also a factor in male pattern baldness so, once more, many men taking finasteride were amazed to find that their hair loss stopped.</p> <p>It comes in a pill form that is taken daily.</p> <p>Some side effects that are seen in more than 1 in 100 men include erectile dysfunction and male breast development.</p> <p>It can cause birth defects in babies so if you are living with a woman then you may wish to reconsider having it around the house.</p> <p>When natural remedies and even medication fails, there are other at-home options that require no pain or surgery yet are still extremely effective for most baldness cases, and more info can be obtained by <a href=" http://www.hairlossbalding.net/go/total-hair-regrowth/" title="grow more hair">clicking here</a>.</p> </div> <!-- .entry-content --> <footer class="entry-meta"> <span class="cat-links"> Posted in <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hairloss,balding/finasteride/" title="View all posts in Finasteride" rel="category tag">Finasteride</a>, <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hairloss,balding/hair-loss-balding-information/" title="View all posts in Hair Loss Balding Information" rel="category tag">Hair Loss Balding Information</a>, <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hairloss,balding/minoxidil/" title="View all posts in Minoxidil" rel="category tag">Minoxidil</a><br /> </span> <span class="tag-links"> Tagged <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hairloss,balding/hair-loss-balding/" rel="tag">hair loss balding</a><br /> </span> <span class="comments-link"><a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/natural-treatments-fail/#comments" rel="nofollow" title="Comment on When Natural Treatments For Hair Loss and Balding Fail">1 Comment</a></span> <br /> </footer> <!-- #entry-meta --> </article> <!-- #post-114 --> <article id="post-59" class="post-59 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-hair-loss-balding-information category-stop-baldness-secrets tag-balding tag-hair-loss tag-hair-loss-balding tag-how-to-grow-hair tag-natural-hair-regrowth"> <header class="entry-header"> <div class="entry-meta"> <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/avoid-baldness-grow-hair-back/" title="9:55 pm" rel="bookmark"><time class="entry-date" datetime="2012-03-09T21:55:22+00:00" pubdate="">March 9, 2012</time></a> <span class="byline"> <span class="sep"> by </span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/author/admin/" title="View all posts by admin" rel="author">admin</a></span></span> </div> <!-- .entry-meta --> <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/avoid-baldness-grow-hair-back/" title="Permalink to What You Can Do To Avoid Baldness" rel="bookmark">What You Can Do To Avoid Baldness</a></h1> </header> <!-- .entry-header --> <div class="entry-content"> <p></p> <h1>Regrow Hair Without Surgery or Medication</h1> <p>If you really want to know how to regrow hair naturally you must first find out the main source of the problem. Because unless you do, all you will be doing is coming back and forth in between solutions but not really going anywhere. In fact you might end up doing more harm than good. </p> <p></p> <h1>Baldness In Men And Women</h1> <p>There are many factors that can attribute to hair recession or massive hair fall and you need to find out which one exactly is responsible for the problem you are having now. Of course male pattern baldness is still the most common cause, but what if you are a woman? To avoid wearing a toupee, a wig, or use hair extensions, this is the reason why you will need to really dig down and see the source of your problem. You can begin by asking your hair stylist; cosmetologists at the salon are well educated on hair, how it grows, and how to keep it healthy, but your hair stylist may also be able to determine the root cause of your baldness or shedding.</p> <p>Other causes of balding or shedding may include; severe mental or emotional stress, excessive use of coloring or bleaching agents, traction alopecia or excessive strain on the scalp due to braiding or corn rowing, hormonal changes, alopecia areata or hair loss or balding due to autoimmune diseases, and many more. Each of these conditions will require a different approach in order to achieve success regardless of whether you’re going to be using conventional or natural methods.</p> <p></p> <h1>Natural Hair Regrowth From <b>Hair Loss Balding</b></h1> <p>The reason why it’s much better to use natural methods as opposed to conventional ones is simple – they’re cheaper, have less to no side effects, and oftentimes more effective. If you’ve been dealing with the problem long enough you’ve probably tried products like, Minoxidil, laser therapy, PUVA or Psoralen Ultra-Violet Radiation, or even Propecia – most, if not all of which, has certain uncomfortable side effects or requires you to continually set time aside for treatment sessions that can also be painful and expensive.</p> <p></p> <h2><b>Hair Loss Balding – Know The Facts</b></h2> <p>Yes, taking the natural route is much safer but it is not without certain risks as well which is why you will still need to do a bit of research before you try one particular product. But know it or not, you can even actually start the treatment without having to purchase anything. Changing your diet over to low fat high fiber will actually already do a lot in terms of promoting hair renewal and growth. You’ll want to concentrate more on food which contain biotins which plays an important role in maintaining healthy hair as well.</p> </div> <!-- .entry-content --> <footer class="entry-meta"> <span class="cat-links"> Posted in <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hairloss,balding/hair-loss-balding-information/" title="View all posts in Hair Loss Balding Information" rel="category tag">Hair Loss Balding Information</a>, <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hairloss,balding/stop-baldness-secrets/" title="View all posts in Stop Baldness Secrets" rel="category tag">Stop Baldness Secrets</a><br /> </span> <span class="tag-links"> Tagged <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hairloss,balding/balding/" rel="tag">balding</a>, <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hairloss,balding/hair-loss/" rel="tag">hair loss</a>, <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hairloss,balding/hair-loss-balding/" rel="tag">hair loss balding</a>, <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hairloss,balding/how-to-grow-hair/" rel="tag">How To Grow Hair</a>, <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hairloss,balding/natural-hair-regrowth/" rel="tag">Natural Hair Regrowth</a><br /> </span> <span class="comments-link"><a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/avoid-baldness-grow-hair-back/#comments" rel="nofollow" title="Comment on What You Can Do To Avoid Baldness">10 Comments</a></span> <br /> </footer> <!-- #entry-meta --> </article> <!-- #post-59 --> <article id="post-25" class="post-25 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-hair-loss-balding-information tag-balding tag-hair-loss tag-hair-loss-balding tag-receding-hairline"> <header class="entry-header"> <div class="entry-meta"> <a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hair-loss-balding-causes/" title="7:54 pm" rel="bookmark"><time class="entry-date" datetime="2012-03-08T19:54:14+00:00" pubdate="">March 8, 2012</time></a> <span class="byline"> <span class="sep"> by </span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/author/admin/" title="View all posts by admin" rel="author">admin</a></span></span> </div> <!-- .entry-meta --> <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="http://www.hairlossbalding.net/hair-loss-balding-causes/" title="Permalink to Hair Loss Balding – Top List of Causes and Solutions" rel="bookmark">Hair Loss Balding – Top List of Causes and Solutions</a></h1> </header> <!-- .entry-header --> <div class="entry-content"> <p></p> <h1>Determine The Causes Of Your Hair Loss and Balding</h1> <p>For more detailed information on how to pin point your root causes for balding and hair loss, and how to naturally stop balding and hair loss at home, <a href="http://hairlossbalding.net/go/total-hair-regrowth/" title="grow more hair">click here</a>.</p> <p></p> <p>Millions of people all over the world are affected by balding and hair loss, and it’s not only the males that suffer this condition; even females are affected by this problem.

Simply put, DHT is a hormone that clings to your hair follicles and kills them – slowly.</p> <p>At first you won’t be able to feel its effects because it works by slowly thinning out your hair, until eventually you will start to see changes within your scalp until such time that it leaves you bald. There are actually many DHT controlling natural products out there. Saw Palmetto, Nettles, Pygeum, and Pumpkin seed oil – all of these can be good solutions and will be worth your while checking upon them further to verify.</p> <p></p> <h2>Ways To Make Your Hair Grow Fast</h2> <h4>Proper Diet:</h4> <p>Another thing Hair Loss Balding has noticed many tend to miss factoring in where hair loss is concerned is proper diet. What you are eating now can either make the problem a lot better or worse. Aside from eating fresh fruits and veggies, you will also want to hydrate yourself properly in order to eliminate any additional afflictions that might be associated to dehydration which can slow or even prevent your recovery.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <h4>Hair Supplements:</h4> <p>There are actually many hair supplement products that you can use to promote natural hair growth and prevent hair loss. Ginseng, Horsetail (equisetum), Nettle, Valerian, Zinc – these products are readily available in the market and Hair Loss Balding recommends every one of them. The only thing you have to do is pick out which one will work for you best, but there is no harm in trying them all.</p> <p></p> <h4>Demystify Your Hair Loss or Balding Problem</h4> <p>The Hair Loss Balding solutions mentioned above are just for starters.

Then don’t be surprised to find that there are actually not that many elsewhere that are truly effective long-term. The reason is very simple – each individual will have his own idea on what is considered to be the best treatment due to varying reasons and factors. For some, it might be the use of conventionally developed creams; others find medicated shampoos to be the solution, while others still think that there is no better treatment aside from hair transplant or hair in a can.</p> <p>Sure, hair transplants are indeed effective, but not many can afford the cost and conventional medications might bring about various side effects as well. Men generally play a hit or miss game where hair loss is concerned, heading for the next biggest fad in hair loss prevention and hoping that they themselves will get the solution that they have been hoping for.</p> <p>But what most men tend to miss is the fact that sometimes the best solution for their problem is already within their reach, they only fail to realize it due to the growing concern that they have regarding their problem. One of the most underestimated methods in treating hair loss would be the natural route. Many men do not even start considering using natural products until they have exhausted what is available in terms of conventional treatments and medications. Hair Loss Balding is an avid promoter of natural, homemade remedies made from simple, inexpensive, and natural products you can get at any grocery store, foods market, herb shop, or vitamins store. </p> <h1>Hair Loss Balding – Grow Hair Back</h1> <p>Hair supplements like Ginseng, Horsetail, Nettle, Valerian, Zinc, Saw Palmetto, Black Currant Oil, Capsicum, Red Sage and others can be effectively used along with natural shampoos, creams, and gels to create a highly individualized treatment from which any individual can benefit. The best part about all of this is the fact that they will generally cost a lot less as compared to conventional treatments and are devoid of any side effects. Two big reason’s they are preferred by Hair Loss Balding for treating a receding hairline or the early stages of baldness.</p> <p>Diet adjustment and sufficient water intake are two other methods that not many pay attention to, because they may seem distant from the problem. But if you really think about it, your hair also utilizes some of the nutrients that go into your body, and the lack of vitamins in your food will also equate to problems with your hair; the same goes for water.</p> <p>So what is the best hair loss treatment for men? There are many and it is your job to find out which particular one will work well for you. Please come back soon for more information.</p> </div> <!-- .entry-content --> <footer class="entry-meta"> <span class="cat-links"> Posted in <a

It was only later that carols began to be sung in church, and to be specifically associated with Christmas. Traditionally, carols have often been based on medieval chord patterns, and it is this that gives them their uniquely characteristic musical sound. Some carols can be traced directly back to the Middle Ages, and are among the oldest musical compositions still regularly sung. <br /><br /> Free Printable Christmas Carol Lyric sheets are great for your family or neighborhood caroling activities. Print some of our Christmas Carol Song sheet pages and teach your group to sing.
