In our article <a href="http://barbadosfreepress.wordpress.com/2008/12/29/thanks-to-prime-minister-david-thompson-barbados-government-officials-can-still-use-their-office-for-personal-profit/" target="_blank"><em>Thanks To Prime Minister David Thompson, Barbados Government Officials Can Still Use Their Office For Personal�Profit</em></a>, we pointed out that by virtue of their insider knowledge, connections and their ability to directly and indirectly influence lawmakers, civil servants are well-positioned to profit from their office and government employment.</p> <p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><em>It looks like that insider knowledge is also able to make certain records disappear from public examination!</em></strong></span></p> <p>If you do an online search the CAIPO - Barbados Corporate Affairs and Intellectual Property Office website for “Harrison” you get a list of 11 or so corporations like this…</p> <p><a href="http://barbadosfreepress.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/harrison-search2.jpg"></a><a href="http://barbadosfreepress.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/barbados-corporate-affairs-search.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8307" title="barbados-corporate-affairs-search" src="http://barbadosfreepress.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/barbados-corporate-affairs-search.jpg?w=500&amp;h=375" alt="barbados-corporate-affairs-search" width="500" height="375" /></a></p> <p>Then, if you click on one of the corporate records, say for the “Old Harrisonian Society”, a window opens up and you get more information, including the name, company number, date registered or incorporated and the category of the company.

Colonel Lee Archer at an airshow in the United States. Lee Archer is one of the original Tuskegee Airmen - the first black US combat pilots who flew in World War II. That was my second meeting with Lt. Colonel Archer. The first happened some ten years earlier at the world’s largest fly-in in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.</p> <p>For all my enthusiasm about aviation and aviation history, until I read a story yesterday at Ian Bourne’s blog<em> (<a href="http://bajanreporter.blogspot.com/2009/01/barbadian-everywhere-one-of-tuskegee.html" target="_blank">The Bajan Reporter</a>)</em>, I never knew that one of the Tuskegee Airmen was from Barbados. Colonel Fitzroy “Buck” Newsum was born in Barbados and at the age of ten saw his first airplane and decided that he was going to be a pilot.</p> <p>Ian has the full story at his blog and the big story which is that the remaining Tuskegee Airmen have been invited by Barack Obama to witness the Inauguration of the first black President of the United States of America.</p> <p><em><strong>A Special Treat For All Those Aviation Enthusiasts Out There</strong></em></p> <p>When I write these aviation articles for Barbados Free Press, I have to be ever so careful to avoid giving too many details because it wouldn’t do to have anyone identify one of the editors of this blog. I may be taking a little chance with the following, but looking back at who was with me at the time and the ten years or so that have passed since I had a need for this item - I think I’m alright to share this with you.</p> <p>Besides, there is a part of me that wants to twist the nose of some of the folks who are desperate to know who writes Barbados Free Press.</p> <p>So here you go folks. I’d wager everything I own that there is not another pilot on this island besides yours truly who has ever had a need for the following item - that still resides in my old flightbag.

Personally I think my OAS and UN work for Indigenous Rights is more important and newsworthy, but that is just me.</p> <p>I would just like to point out that it was I some years ago - who said that “There are possibly up to 10 escaped/released illegally imported pets that I was aware of that may or may not still be at large in Barbados”, the capture of the first one (an 11 foot long Burmese python - Python molurus molurus) by Inspector Wayne Norville of the RSPCA was not publicized (this occurred unbeknown to myself prior to my ‘10 snake’ estimate statement), and I subsequently did my own ‘investigation’ and found out that the 3 Boa constrictors that were cut to pieces long before in cane fields before my estimate - were escapees from 3 different persons I had factored in to my 10 estimate. More recently one 6 foot escapee Boa constrictor (from a facility that does not admit to this truth) was captured in St. Andrew 2 hills away from where it was last spotted and I had last searched in vain for it (and it was well covered by the Nation Newspaper). Most recently - a 4 foot Boid was killed in the Mt. Hillaby area. So this accounts for 6 of the 10.</p> <h2 style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><em>At the time I had made the statement - people in high positions in this country preferred to disbelieve me and were of the opinion that there were NO such large snakes ‘on the loose’ and the public was either concocting tales or imaging the sightings.</em></strong></span></h2> <p>More recently a well known Radio personality was having a grand old time making fun of our efforts and asking where all the snakes have disappeared to in the last 2 years since there had been no further incidents.</p> <p>To these people I will say again - there are at least 4 more I suspect to already be out there, and from time to time, here and there, now and then - one by one (to make it as simple and concise as I can) the other 4 will be discovered; in the days, weeks, months and years to come.</p> <div id="attachment_8243" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 210px"> <img class="size-full wp-image-8243" title="barbados-large-snake" src="http://barbadosfreepress.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/barbados-large-snake.jpg?w=200&amp;h=241" alt="Another Large Snake Killed In Barbados (Nation News Photo Dec 28, 2008)" width="200" height="241" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Another Large Snake Killed In Barbados (Nation News Photo Dec 28, 2008)</p> </div> <p>In the interim - I can only advise the public that NONE of them are poisonous as they are all Boids (Boas and Pythons) and 3 of the 4 are too small in size to pose a threat to human beings, the only folks who should be cautious and not allow their children to venture into gully areas to explore and play are the good people of the Mt. Hillaby area - many of whom saw with their own eyes the 16 foot Burmese Python that a guy called ‘Otis’ had as a ‘pet’ and released in their area (VERY IRRESPONSIBLY) some years ago. It might be long dead (though I am not aware of a carcass ever having been found), if still alive it could be feeding infrequently by night on the Barbados Green monkeys (as the monkeys sleep blissfully unaware) that are common in the surrounding gullies that contain water all year round, it would need to feed only 6-8 times per year on an adult monkey to survive; residents of Mt. Hillaby said fowls have disappeared and a large piece of shed skin was found by a nearby Plantation owner, I recall being told via a phone call about this shed skin also but saw the gentleman who said he was bringing it for me.</p> <p>Mr. Romeo Yarde (Caribbean Herpetological Society member) was good enough to venture to meet with the Mt. Hillaby folk and spent 2 hours answering their many queries and concerns (up to that point they told him no-one came to answer any of their questions and they were relieved that Mr. Yarde had come), he met with a fellow who’s nickname was ‘Smurf’, this fellow was the one who killed the 4 foot snake with a Hoe, residents told Mr. Yarde about ‘Otis’ and his large pet python (the one that many armchair critics here who know nothing at all are fond of saying ‘never existed’), he saw where the residents had burned the carcass of the 4 foot snake to oblivion - thereby rendering positive ID impossible, though from the Nation photo side profile of the specimen looks to be a Guyana Rainbow Boa (Epicrates cenchria maurus) - but until I see a top view photograph I cannot be 100% certain about the species.</p> <p>Again, no-one wishes Barbadians to be any more ’snake-phobic’ than they are already, but neither do I nor any Caribbean Herpetological Society member wish to see a child harmed by the ONE specimen that has the potential to do this (if it is still alive), that is why <span style="color:#ff0000;">I urge the Mt. Hillaby residents to exercise caution in remote areas, and DO NOT allow your children to venture into the gullies that surround you without an adult - and certainly not at night.</span></p> <p><em><strong>Search Volunteers Needed</strong></em></p> <p>I am preparing to do day and night searches of the gullies surrounding Mt. Hillaby, but this will depend on me securing many volunteers from within the Caribbean Herpetological Society membership (anyone interested in joining can freely do so at <em><a href="http://www.corriebusinessgroup.com/PetDepot/hs/" target="_blank">www.corriebusinessgroup.com/PetDepot/hs</a></em>) because from Mr. Yarde’s report there is a LOT of ground to cover, our goal would be to look for signs of the presence of a large Boid, tracks, scat, sleeping areas, shed skin etc. If fortune smiles on us we will find it (or remains thereof) and relieve the stress and fear that many Mt. Hillaby residents endure.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,</p> <p>Damon Gerard Corrie<br />Founder/President<br />Caribbean Herpetological Society <em>(<a href="http://www.corriebusinessgroup.com/PetDepot/hs/" target="_blank">website link here</a>)</em></p> <p><strong>Further Reading </strong><em>(Listed By BFP Editor)</em></p> <p>Nation - <a href="http://www.nationnews.com/editorial/312658870153102.php" target="_blank"><em>Not Enough Information On Snake</em></a></p> </div> </div> <div class="post_meta"> <p class="num_comments"><a href="http://barbadosfreepress.wordpress.com/2009/01/03/large-dangerous-snake-alert-in-barbados-do-not-allow-your-children-to-venture-into-the-gullies/#comments" title="Comment on Large Dangerous Snake Alert In Barbados: “DO NOT allow your children to venture into the&nbsp;gullies…”">12 Comments</a></p> <p class="tagged">Filed under <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/barbados/" title="View all posts in Barbados" rel="category tag">Barbados</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/barbados-tourism/" title="View all posts in Barbados Tourism" rel="category tag">Barbados Tourism</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/disaster/" title="View all posts in Disaster" rel="category tag">Disaster</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/environment/" title="View all posts in Environment" rel="category tag">Environment</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/ethics/" title="View all posts in Ethics" rel="category tag">Ethics</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/freedom-of-the-press/" title="View all posts in Freedom Of The Press" rel="category tag">Freedom Of The Press</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/health/" title="View all posts in Health" rel="category tag">Health</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/nature/" title="View all posts in Nature" rel="category tag">Nature</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/science/" title="View all posts in Science" rel="category tag">Science</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/tourism/" title="View all posts in Tourism" rel="category tag">Tourism</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/travel/" title="View all posts in Travel" rel="category tag">Travel</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/traveling-and-tourism/" title="View all posts in Traveling and Tourism" rel="category tag">Traveling and Tourism</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/wildlife/" title="View all posts in Wildlife" rel="category tag">Wildlife</a></p> <p class="tagged">Tags: <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/anaconda/" rel="tag">Anaconda</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/barbados/" rel="tag">Barbados</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/barbados-tourism/" rel="tag">Barbados Tourism</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/boa/" rel="tag">Boa</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/constrictor-snakes/" rel="tag">Constrictor Snakes</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/deadly-snakes/" rel="tag">Deadly Snakes</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/large-snakes/" rel="tag">Large Snakes</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/snake-attack/" rel="tag">Snake Attack</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/snakes/" rel="tag">Snakes</a><br /></p> </div> </div> <div class="post hentry category-barbados category-barbados-tourism category-energy category-environment category-political-corruption category-politics category-politics-corruption category-sugar tag-barbados tag-barbados-tourism tag-energy tag-environment tag-ethanol tag-sugar-industry" id="post-8212"> <h4>January 2, 2009 <!-- by BFP --></h4> <h2><a href="http://barbadosfreepress.wordpress.com/2009/01/02/barbados-government-kills-ethanol-proposal-bizzy-williams-should-read-bfp-to-find-out-why-he-was-turned-down/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Barbados Government Kills Ethanol Proposal - Bizzy Williams Should Read BFP To Find Out Why He Was Turned&nbsp;Down">Barbados Government Kills Ethanol Proposal - Bizzy Williams Should Read BFP To Find Out Why He Was Turned&nbsp;Down</a></h2> <div class="entry"> <div class="snap_preview"> <p style="padding-left:30px;"></p> <div id="attachment_2621" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 210px"> <img class="size-full wp-image-2621" title="bizzy-williams-barbados-girl.jpg" src="http://barbadosfreepress.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/bizzy-williams-barbados-girl.jpg?w=200&amp;h=200" alt="Any man of Bizzy's age who can party until 8am has our respect!" width="200" height="200" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Any man of Bizzy's age who can party until 8am has our respect!</p> </div> <p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Chairman of Williams Industries, Ralph “Bizzy” Williams, says he is “disappointed” that permission was not granted to build an ethanol plant.

He and his family have worked hard and smart over the years to the point where Williams Industries and associated companies provide employment directly and indirectly for thousands of people. But business and making money is not all that defines Bizzy Williams.</p> <p>Without going into details, we at BFP can assure you that Bizzy has a kind heart and does much good for people in a quiet manner. It is his way to help with a “hand up, not a hand out” and there are many who have benefited from his encouragement, mentoring and interest in helping people improve themselves and their lives. Once again, we can’t say much more than that, but some folks would be amazed if they knew ten percent of what Bizzy has done for ordinary people.</p> <p><em><strong>That’s Some Of The Good About Bizzy Williams - Now For Some Of The Bad…</strong></em></p> <p>Like all business people, Bizzy and his family tend to make choices that are good for their pocketbooks but might not be so good for the country, the environment and the poor taxpayers. No, we’re not saying that all business people are uncaring slash and burn artists or that the Williams family deliberately sets out to harm the country or people. We are saying that without effective oversight, accountability and the rule of law applied by a good government that is watching out for the citizens’ interests, business people make choices that benefit themselves first and sometimes are against the interests of ordinary citizens.</p> <p style="padding-left:30px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8234" title="port-st-charles-barbados-beach" src="http://barbadosfreepress.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/port-st-charles-barbados-beach.jpg?w=466&amp;h=153" alt="port-st-charles-barbados-beach" width="466" height="153" /></p> <p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><em><span style="color:#ff0000;">For example, when Bizzy Williams deliberately designed the Port St. Charles development to prevent ordinary Bajans from accessing the beach, he raised the value of the individual condos and made more profit.<br /></span></em></strong></p> <p>Yup… Bizzy designed that delightful north beach area to be a private beach for the rich folks. Oh sure, you can crawl under the bridge and cut your feet all to pieces on the sharp stones and concrete of the breakwater and then arrive at the beach just ahead of the security guards who ask just what you think you’re doing and caution that if you put one foot above the high water mark they will drag your sorry black ass out of there. Yes friends, that is the welcome you’ll receive if you dare to set foot on the sand at Port St. Charles beach.</p> <p>What should be a public beach. Your beach.</p> <p>That was a design choice that Bizzy made and it was a darn good choice for raising the prices of the condos and putting more money into his pocket. Private beaches are a big selling point at Port St. Charles - even if they use the word “secluded” instead of “private”.</p> <p>But that choice is a violation of the spirit of the law, if not the law itself. It is also a very visible and simple example of how the world is run when we let business people do whatever they want.

There are concerns about the proximity to tourist beaches, potential for major spills, reliance upon copious amounts of already scarce fresh water, and the long-term cost-benefit viability of ethanol as a fuel. Tons and tons and tons - tens of thousands of gallons - of liquid toxic waste will be produced daily should the ethanol factory go ahead.</p> <p style="padding-left:30px;">Not to mention that your proposal did not include a comprehensive environmental impact study or an economic study of the impact your factory would have upon tourism.</p> <p style="padding-left:30px;">For all of those reasons and more, your project was refused.</p> <p style="padding-left:30px;">Here are a few BFP articles you should read…</p> <p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><a href="http://barbadosfreepress.wordpress.com/2008/04/11/barbados-government-kills-sugar-for-ethanol-scam-thank-you-barbados-free-press-without-your-revelations/" target="_blank"><em>Barbados Government Kills Sugar Cane Ethanol Scam</em></a></strong></p> <p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Government Insider Thanks Barbados Free Press For Exposing Secret Ethanol Reports</em></p> <p style="padding-left:30px;">The current Barbados Government has killed plans for a sugar-based ethanol industry - largely due to revelations by Barbados Free Press that the previous BLP government had covered up secret European Union reports showing that the Arthur-Mottley governments ethanol plans were technically and economically not viable.</p> <p style="padding-left:30px;">We are told that one of the first acts of newly minted Minister of Agriculture Haynesley Benn (photo above) was to ask to see ALL VERSIONS of the European Union sugar reports as first revealed in BFPs article<a href="http://barbadosfreepress.wordpress.com/2007/08/20/secret-european-union-report-slams-barbados-ethanol-plan/" target="_blank"><em> Secret European Union Reports Slam Barbados Ethanol Plan</em></a>.</p> <p style="padding-left:30px;">It didnt take the Thompson Government very long to discover that the ethanol plan was a sham - and most likely just another scam to facilitate the transfer of tax revenues to greedy pockets with no appreciable benefit to Barbados and her citizens.</p> <p style="padding-left:30px;">Our source who originally showed us the three different versions of one of the EU copies of the reports said&amp;</p> <p style="padding-left:30px;">Thank you Barbados Free Press.

This government employee knew that cane ethanol was not viable for Barbados, and that the Arthur-Mottley government was deliberately concealing data and reports so they could justify a course of action that, according to our source, had the primary purpose of lining the pockets of certain very narrow interests.</p> <p style="padding-left:30px;">By last August, the government employee decided that he must reveal the truth - but how? In the end he came to Barbados Free Press with his story, and the rest as they say, is history. When the new Agriculture Minister asked to see ALL VERSIONS of the secret European Union reports as mentioned in the Barbados Free Press article, that was the end for cane ethanol…</p> <p style="padding-left:30px;">… continue reading this report <a href="http://barbadosfreepress.wordpress.com/2008/04/11/barbados-government-kills-sugar-for-ethanol-scam-thank-you-barbados-free-press-without-your-revelations/" target="_blank"><em>LINK HERE</em></a></p> </div> </div> <div class="post_meta"> <p class="num_comments"><a href="http://barbadosfreepress.wordpress.com/2009/01/02/barbados-government-kills-ethanol-proposal-bizzy-williams-should-read-bfp-to-find-out-why-he-was-turned-down/#comments" title="Comment on Barbados Government Kills Ethanol Proposal - Bizzy Williams Should Read BFP To Find Out Why He Was Turned&nbsp;Down">61 Comments</a></p> <p class="tagged">Filed under <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/barbados/" title="View all posts in Barbados" rel="category tag">Barbados</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/barbados-tourism/" title="View all posts in Barbados Tourism" rel="category tag">Barbados Tourism</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/energy/" title="View all posts in Energy" rel="category tag">Energy</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/environment/" title="View all posts in Environment" rel="category tag">Environment</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/political-corruption/" title="View all posts in Political Corruption" rel="category tag">Political Corruption</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/politics/" title="View all posts in Politics" rel="category tag">Politics</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/politics-corruption/" title="View all posts in Politics &amp; Corruption" rel="category tag">Politics &amp; Corruption</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/sugar/" title="View all posts in Sugar" rel="category tag">Sugar</a></p> <p class="tagged">Tags: <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/barbados/" rel="tag">Barbados</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/barbados-tourism/" rel="tag">Barbados Tourism</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/energy/" rel="tag">Energy</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/environment/" rel="tag">Environment</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/ethanol/" rel="tag">Ethanol</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/sugar-industry/" rel="tag">Sugar Industry</a><br /></p> </div> </div> <div class="post hentry category-barbados category-history category-slavery tag-barbados tag-barbados-history tag-history tag-slavery" id="post-8191"> <h4>January 1, 2009 <!-- by BFP --></h4> <h2><a href="http://barbadosfreepress.wordpress.com/2009/01/01/adrian-loveridges-traitor-ancestor-sold-as-slave-in-barbados/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Adrian Loveridge’s Traitor and Criminal Ancestors Sold As Slaves In&nbsp;Barbados?">Adrian Loveridge’s Traitor and Criminal Ancestors Sold As Slaves In&nbsp;Barbados?</a></h2> <div class="entry"> <div class="snap_preview"> <div id="attachment_8204" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"> <a href="http://www.us.archive.org/GnuBook/?id=originallistsofp00hottuoft#5" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-8204" title="barbados-loveridge-rebels" src="http://barbadosfreepress.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/barbados-loveridge-rebels.jpg?w=500&amp;h=234" alt="Click The Photo To View &amp; Search The Lists Of Rebels Transported To Barbadoes And Other Places" width="500" height="234" /></a> <p class="wp-caption-text">Click The Photo To View &amp; Search The Lists Of Rebels Transported To Barbadoes And Other Places</p> </div> <p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>8 July 1685.

Readers are referred to PHL &sect; 29-B and DOH Memo 92-32, DNR Orders that are the governing documents for detailed discussions on the subject. This policy <em>does not</em> supercede any other DOH document.</p> <p>These guidelines are intended to assist local emergency medical services (EMS) agencies in developing DNR policies. EMS agencies should develop policies that instruct crews how to properly respond to patients who have a DNR. DNR policies allowing patients to refuse resuscitation ensure that patient's legal rights are honored and are a critical part of the healthcare and EMS systems. Patients must be provided their legal and ethical rights to consent to or refuse medical care in the prehospital setting. DNR patients are generally, although not always, victims of terminal illnesses, and are encountered in skilled nursing facilities, private residences and other settings. They may or may not be clients of hospices. In some cases, patients use the EMS system solely to obtain medical transportation. In other cases accident victims may present a DNR order.</p> <p>Despite instructions not to perform resuscitation or call an ambulance, family members and employees of nursing facilities frequently activate 9-1-1 when death is imminent.</p> <p>In addition to providing palliative care for patients, prehospital care providers may benefit families by assisting in determining when death has occurred. This <em>may</em> be an appropriate role for the EMS system although it should be restricted to private residences and not to licensed facilities which are expected to have policies for determining death by house medical staff.</p> <p>EMS agencies are encouraged to meet with all components (hospitals, nursing facilities, hospices, etc.) of the health care system in their community in order to develop common understandings and policies to mutually manage patients with DNRs in emergency situations.</p> <p><strong>What is an &quot;Out of Hospital&quot; DNR?</strong></p> <p>The New York State Department of Health has an approved standard <strong>Out of Hospital DNR</strong> form that is legally recognized statewide for DNR requests occurring outside of Article 28 licensed facilities. This form is intended for patients <em>not</em> originating from a hospital or nursing home. The form (DOH-3474) is available on the Department's web site ( <a href="/">www.health.state.ny.us</a> ) or from your local DOH EMS Office or health department. There are NO other approved Out of Hospital DNR forms. Copies can be kept on ambulances and made available to patients, facilities or physicians as a part of their community education program.</p> <p><strong>What is a recognized DNR Bracelet?</strong></p> <p>A standard DOH approved metal bracelet, worn by the patient, which includes a caduceus and the words &quot;Do Not Resuscitate&quot;. EMT's should assume that a DNR order is in place authorizing the bracelet. It is not necessary to locate the written DNR order.</p> <p><strong>Where/When is an Out of Hospital DNR Order Valid?</strong></p> <p>For any patient <em>NOT</em> originating from a hospital or nursing facility including but not limited to:</p> <ul> <li>The patient's home</li> <li>A hospice</li> <li>A clinic</li> </ul> <p><strong>What determines the validity of the Out of Hospital DNR?</strong></p> <ul> <li>Merely the presentation of a signed Out of Hospital DNR form (or a copy) or a DNR bracelet to the EMT.</li> <li>A good faith attempt to identify the patient. A witness who can reliably identify the patient is useful.</li> <li>Out of hospital DNRs do not expire.</li> <li>The Out of Hospital DNR form and/or bracelet should be taken with the patient.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Hospital &amp; Nursing Home DNR orders</strong></p> <p>All Article 28 licensed facilities are required to issue, review and maintain DNR orders. EMS providers will honor hospital DNR orders for patient transports originating from the facility. The DNR <em>can not</em> be expired. The facility staff must provide a copy of the order and/or patient's chart with the recorded DNR order to the ambulance crew. Facilities, other than hospitals or nursing homes, are encouraged to use the NYS-DOH approved non-hospital DNR Form as supplemental documentation to avoid confusion and potentially unwanted resuscitation.</p> <p><strong>May EMS providers accept living wills or health care proxies?</strong></p> <p>A living will or health care proxy is <em>NOT</em> valid in the prehospital setting.</p> <p><strong>Under what circumstances may an EMS provider disregard an Out of Hospital DNR order?</strong></p> <ul> <li>Any case where there is reasonable evidence to suggest that the DNR order has been revoked or cancelled.</li> <li>If the patient is conscious and states that they wish resuscitative measures, the DNR Form should be ignored.</li> <li>If the patient is unable to state his or her desire and a family member is present and requests resuscitative measures for the patient and a confrontational situation is likely to result, if the request is denied.</li> <li>A physician directs that the order be disregarded.</li> </ul> <p><strong>What procedures are and are not preformed if the patient presents a DNR?</strong></p> <ul> <li>Do not resuscitate (DNR) means, for the patient in cardiac or respiratory arrest, NO chest compressions, ventilation, defibrillation, endotracheal intubation, or medications.</li> <li>If the patient is NOT in cardiac or respiratory arrest, full treatment for all injuries, pain, difficult or insufficient breathing, hemorrhage and/or other medical conditions must be provided.</li> <li>Relief of choking caused by a foreign body is usually appropriate, although if breathing has stopped, ventilation should not be assisted.</li> <li>CPR must be initiated if no Out of Hospital or facility DNR is presented. If a DNR order is presented after CPR has been started, stop CPR.</li> <li>For unusual situations or questions on individual patient circumstances, contact medical control.</li> </ul> <p><strong>What documentation is required for a patient with a DNR order?</strong></p> <ul> <li>Emergency medical technicians/paramedics should attach a copy of the Out of Hospital DNR form, hospital DNR order and/or copy of the patient's chart to the patient care report, along with all other usual documentation. It should be noted on the patient care report that a written DNR order was present including the name of the physician, date signed and other appropriate information.</li> <li>If the cardiac/respiratory arrest occurred during transport, the DNR Form should accompany the patient so that it may be incorporated into the medical record at the receiving facility.</li> <li>Patients who are identified as dead at the scene need not be transported by ambulance, however, local EMS agencies should consider transportation for DNR patients who collapse in public locations. In these cases it may be necessary to transport the individual to a hospital without resuscitative measures in order to move the body to a location that provides privacy. Local policies need to be coordinated with the Medical Examiner/Coroner and law enforcement.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Liability Protections</strong></p> <p>PHL Section 2977.12 &quot;No person shall be subjected to criminal prosecution or civil liability, or be deemed to have engaged in unprofessional conduct, for honoring reasonably and in good faith pursuant to this section a non hospital order not to resuscitate, for disregarding a non hospital order pursuant to section ten of this section, or for other actions taken reasonably and in good faith pursuant to this section&quot;.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div id="footer"> <div id="reviseddate"> Revised: December 1999 </div> <div id="footerbuttons"> <ul> <li><a href="/nysdoh/disclaim.htm">Disclaimer</a></li> <li><a href="/nysdoh/privacy.htm">Privacy Policy</a></li> <li><a href="/contact/accessibility.htm">Accessibility</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> </body> </html>

FAQ</strong></h1> <p><strong>What is the Pennsylvania Certified Paralegal Program?</strong><br /> The Program is a voluntary certification program that is regulated through the Keystone Alliance of Paralegal Associations.&nbsp; The Program challenges Paralegals to meet the minimum level of qualifications under either the Grandfathering or Educational Requirements.&nbsp; </p> <p><strong>Why did the Keystone Alliance of Paralegal Associations choose to certify paralegals?</strong><br /> The Keystone Alliance of Paralegal Associations is offering a voluntary certification program to paralegals who are current members of one of the member associations of the Keystone Alliance of Paralegal Associations to identify individuals who are qualified by education, work experience and training and have the knowledge, skill and proficiency to perform substantive legal work requiring the knowledge of concepts and ethics and is employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental agency, or other entity to work under the direction of a lawyer or pursuant to state statute, administrative regulation or court authority in a capacity that, in most instances, would be performed by a lawyer in the absence of a paralegal and to improve the proficiency and aptitude of those individuals by establishing mandatory continuing legal education and other requirements of certification.</p> <p><strong>Why did the Keystone Alliance of Paralegal Associations chose to create a voluntary program?</strong><br /> The Keystone Alliance of Paralegal Associations is offering a voluntary certification program to those individuals who chose to become a Pennsylvania Certified Paralegal and use the designation of Pa.C.P. to provide paralegal employees and employers a benchmark of qualified individuals that are competent to provide legal services under the supervision of an attorney.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why would a Paralegal choose to apply for the Pennsylvania Certified Paralegal program?</strong><br /> Voluntary certification is a decision that each qualified individual must make for themselves.&nbsp; Choosing to become certified would demonstrate a commitment to the paralegal profession and provide recognition that the professional standards have been met. &nbsp;Certified paralegals are required to take continuing legal education courses in order to assist in keeping current in the legal field. &nbsp;When choosing employment, the hiring process becomes easier as credentials are already verified through this program.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Will becoming a Pennsylvania Certified Paralegal help me find employment or obtain a promotion?</strong><br /> Becoming a Pennsylvania Certified Paralegal offers employers a benchmark for hiring and possible promotion opportunities.&nbsp; It is the hope of the Keystone Alliance of Paralegal Associations that the Pennsylvania Certified Paralegal program will become the standard for hiring and/or promoting paralegals.<br /> <br /> <strong>What is the best way to present the Pennsylvania Certified Paralegal program to my employer?<br /> </strong>Attorneys need to know that the paralegals they employ are qualified through education, experience and training to provide legal services to their clients and members of the public.&nbsp; &nbsp;This program is voluntary, yet it gives the employer a benchmark of the minimum standards of a qualified paralegal that they are considering for hire or promotion.&nbsp; Even though paralegals work directly under the supervision of an attorney, paralegals are under the same ethical duties and requirements as attorneys to prevent the unauthorized practice of law.&nbsp;

But it gets easier with practice. Research shows that every time you try to quit, you boost your chances of quitting for good. Your chance of success is even higher if you combine quit methods like counselling, nicotine replacement (&quot;the patch&quot;) or other medications.</p> <p>Quitting smoking is a process that requires careful planning, courage, discipline, and commitment. You can succeed by following this advice:</p> <ul> <li><a href="#steps">Four steps to quitting</a></li> <li><a href="#methods">Proven quit smoking methods</a></li> <li><a href="#withdrawal">Nicotine withdrawal: symptoms &amp; remedies</a></li> <li><a href="#cope">How to cope with cravings</a></li> <li><a href="#list">Quitting checklist</a></li> </ul> <h5><a name="steps"></a>Four steps to quitting smoking</h5> <ol> <li><strong>Pick a quit day</strong><br /> Choose a date within the next two or three weeks to quit. Having a deadline makes it easier to plan how you will handle the people, places and situations that make you want to smoke. Try to choose a time that is not particularly stressful. But don't wait forever for the &quot;perfect&quot; day - pick a quit date now and work with it.</li> <li><strong>Chosen one or more proven quit-smoking methods</strong><br /> Your chances of success are greater if you combine quit methods like counselling, self-help guides, the patch and other medicines. Learn more about <a href="#methods">methods to help you quit smoking</a>. Choose the methods that will work best for you. It also helps to: <ul> <li>List your reasons for quitting - health, family, money</li> <li>Write down the things that can replace smoking: healthy alternatives like exercise, or a new hobby</li> <li>Speak with friends, family, and colleagues who can give you support. Tell them about your plan to quit, so it feels more real to you</li> <li>Start making the lifestyle changes that will support your plan - leave cigarettes at home when you go out, remove the ashtrays from your home</li> <li>Consider joining a support group. Some people find it helpful to talk to others who are also trying to quit. <a href="/about-propos/provincial-provinciales_e.php">Contact your provincial Lung Association</a> to find a support group in your community.</li> </ul></li> <br /> <li><strong>Work your plan</strong><br /> <ul> <li>It's your quit date. Be firm that you won't smoke.</li> <li>Review your plan often. Knowing how you're going to handle the urge to smoke will help you better <a href="#cope">cope with cravings</a></li> <li>Avoid those people and situations where you will be tempted to smoke</li> <li>Go for a walk instead of a smoke.</li> <li>Find a hobby that keeps your hands and mind busy</li> <li>Clean your teeth, your clothes, your house of that stale tobacco smell</li> <li>Be positive. You are choosing to be smoke-free</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Celebrate your success</strong><br /> <ul> <li>Believe in yourself and your plan</li> <li>Understand that it takes time to re-learn smoke-free habits</li> <li>Remember, that quitting is a process, not an event</li> <li>Though your recovery begins within hours of your last smoke, it takes at least three weeks to make a new habit. Don't be discouraged if you slip. It's part of the process. You are not a failure. Review your plan and ask yourself how you can do it differently next time.</li> <li>Reward yourself</li> </ul></li> </ol><h5><a name="methods"></a>Proven quit smoking methods</h5> <p>Most people who quit smoking use a combination of quit methods. Research shows people are more likely to succeed in quitting smoking if they combine several supports<a href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p> <p>For example, you can join a support group, and also have some gum or patches on hand to overcome cravings. You will need to find the combination of supports that works best for you.</p> <p><strong>Here are some of the most common quit methods</strong>:</p> <h6><strong>Support groups/counselling</strong></h6> <p>Most people find it helpful to join a support group, get counselling or read self-help books. This type of support will help you understand what to expect and better cope with withdrawal symptoms. <a href="/about-propos/provincial-provinciales_e.php">Contact your provincial Lung Association to find out more about support groups</a> and programs offered in your community.</p> <h6><strong>Nicotine replacement therapies</strong></h6> <p>Nicotine replacement therapies come in many different forms: skin patches, gum, sprays and inhalers. They have small amounts of nicotine in them and can help take the edge of cravings. These products work by slowly reducing the amount of nicotine delivered to your body to help you handle withdrawal symptoms more easily. Research shows these are effective in helping people to quit smoking, especially when combined with counselling or self-help.</p> <p>More about <a href="/protect-protegez/tobacco-tabagisme/quitting-cesser/medications-medicaments_e.php#nrt">nicotine replacement therapies</a></p> <h6><strong>Antidepressant drugs</strong></h6> <p>Bupropion SR (Zyban) is a prescription antidepressant drug that can reduce the urge to smoke in some people. It's most effective in helping people quit when it's combined with other quit methods like counselling.</p> <p>More about <a href="/protect-protegez/tobacco-tabagisme/quitting-cesser/medications-medicaments_e.php">medication to help you quit smoking</a></p> <h6><strong>Unproven methods to quit smoking</strong></h6> <p><strong>Acupuncture and related therapies</strong>: Acupuncture is based on traditional Chinese healing. It uses needles to stimulate energy points in the body. Acupuncture is promoted as a way to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms in people who quit smoking. Some related therapies that have also been used as quit smoking aids are:</p> <ul> <li>Acupressure</li> <li>Electrostimulation</li> <li>Laser therapy</li> </ul> <p>There is not enough evidence to recommend these therapies to quit smoking<a href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a>. More studies are needed before we can say if acupunture or related treatments help people quit smoking.<a href="#f2"><sup>3</sup></a>. It's best to check with your doctor before spending money on these therapies.</p> <p><strong>Hypnosis</strong>: Hypnosis or hypnotherapy is often promoted as a way to help people stop smoking. There are different types of hypnotherapies - some are meant to lessen the desire to smoke and others aim to increase the will to quit.</p> <p>There is no evidence to show that hypnotherapy works as a treatment for helping people quit smoking<a href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p> <h5><a name="withdrawal"></a>Nicotine withdrawal</h5> <p>Withdrawal is your body's response to being without the drug nicotine. Everyone who quits smoking should expect some withdrawal symptoms. </p> <h6>Common withdrawal symptoms:</h6> <ul> <li>Craving for a cigarette</li> <li>Feeling tired</li> <li>Cough</li> <li>Gas/stomach pain</li> <li>Hunger</li> <li>Headache</li> <li>Feeling irritable (bad mood)</li> <li>Trouble concentrating</li> </ul> <p>Symptoms of withdrawal and how long they last are different for everyone. In general, symptoms begin within hours of stopping smoking and can be worse in the evening. Symptoms tend to decrease over the first 4-5 days. Some people have stronger symptoms than others.</p> <h5>Withdrawal symptoms &amp; remedies</h5> <br /> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td id="head"><strong>Signs &amp; symptoms</strong></td> <td id="head"><strong>Causes</strong></td> <td id="head"><strong>How long it lasts</strong></td> <td id="head"><strong>What you can do</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td id="outline"><strong>Irritability</strong> (bad mood)</td> <td id="outline">Body's craving for nicotine</td> <td id="outline">2-4 weeks</td> <td id="outline">Walks, hot baths, relaxation techniques e.g. soft music, stretching</td> </tr> <tr> <td id="alt"><strong>Feeling tired, lack of energy</strong></td> <td id="alt">Nicotine is a stimulant - it keeps your brain active.

This flushes the nicotine and other chemicals out of your system faster. It can help to keep your mouth busy.</p> <p>2. <strong>Deep breaths</strong></p> <p>Take a deep breath break instead of a smoke break. Take a few deep breaths. Hold the last one. Breathe out slowly.</p> <p>3. <strong>Delay</strong></p> <p>As a smoker you were not always in control. You smoked when your body wanted nicotine. By delaying or holding off, you are calling the shots. Often the craving for a cigarette can pass in a few minutes.</p> <p>4. <strong>Do something different</strong></p> <p>When a craving hits, it helps to get out of your current situation. Change what you're doing. Step outside. Call a friend. Read a book. Do something different. Some people find it helpful to do something with their hands when a craving strikes like squeezing a stress ball or knitting. </p> <h5><a name="list"></a>Quitting checklist</h5> <ul> <li>Pick a quit date and mark it on your calendar or post it on your fridge. </li> <li>Write your personal reasons for quitting on a card. Carry that card with you and look at it when you are feeling unsure about your decision to quit or have the urge to smoke.</li> <li>Before you quit record the time, location and your feelings (bored, stressed, angry) for each cigarette you smoke. Try and do this for a couple of days. Look at your smoking patterns and plan how you will handle everyday situations in which you normally smoke.</li> <li>Make smoking less comfortable and easy: Switch hands when you smoke, carry cigarettes in a different place, switch to a brand you don't like, don't carry a lighter or matches.</li> <li>Find things to replace your most important cigarettes. For example, if you always smoke first thing in the morning try chewing a piece of nicotine gum or go for a walk instead.</li> <li>Make an appointment to have your teeth cleaned on quit day. The fresh taste in your mouth and whiter teeth will help keep you motivated.</li> <li>Remind yourself that quitting is a process. You had to learn to smoke. You need to take the time to learn how not to smoke.</li> </ul> <p><strong>References</strong>:</p> <p>1. <a name="f1"></a>Fiore MC, Bailey WC, Cohen SJ, et al. Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence.

They can do research, prepare documents, write briefs, and analyze case law. They could gather information to prepare for trial, such as the analysis of documents or the questioning of clients or witnesses. <br /> <br />Does this mean that paralegals can work on their own? <br /> <br />No paralegal can practice law. While a paralegal can do some of the tasks that a lawyer does, such as research and writing, no jurisdiction licenses paralegals to engage in the practice of law on their own. The practice of law includes making appearances as legal representatives for a client, offering of legal advice, or signing legal documents on the client's behalf. <br /> <br />Any law-related work that a paralegal does has to be supervised and approved by an attorney. <br /> <br />How is a paralegal different from a legal secretary? <br /> <br />Paralegals may also do typing and copying. But because they understand more of the content that they're dealing with, they can do many of the tasks that a lawyer might do, but more cheaply. <br /> <br />Can paralegals specialize? <br /> <br />They certainly can; in fact, that may enhance their marketability in the marketplace, since the paralegal has developed a comprehensive understanding of a specific area of the law. <br /> <br />A lawyer who regularly represents buyers or sellers of land may rely upon the paralegal to prepare those documents necessary for completing the sale. So paralegals could develop expertise in preparing such documents. <br /> <br /> <br /> <center> <a href="#top">Back to Top</a> </center> <br /> <a name="employment">EMPLOYMENT</a> <br /> <br />How much of a demand exists, in the marketplace, for paralegals? <br /> <br />According to the U.S. Department of Labor, paralegals and legal assistants are among the ten fastest growing occupations, with projected growth in the field, until 2008, increasing by 62%. <br /> <br />What accounts for such an increase in the demand for paralegals? <br /> <br />While the United States has many law schools which graduate excellent candidates for certification as a lawyer, there is an increasing demand for legal services, especially for low costs legal services. By relying on paralegals to do some of the work, a single lawyer can offer lower cost services to more clients. <br /> <br /> <br /> <center> <a href="#top">Back to Top</a> </center> <br /> <a name="cert">CERTIFICATION</a> OF PARALEGALS <br /> <br />Is there a certification test which someone has to pass before being able to work as a paralegal? <br /> <br />No. States don't regulate the activities of paralegals by imposing mandatory certification requirements. <br /> <br />Why don't states require certification of paralegals before they work in the field of law? <br /> <br />They recognize that paralegals can provide a wide range of services when working with a lawyer more cheaply than if the lawyer had provided such services. <br /> <br />The states also have recognized that having paralegals pass a certification test would increase the costs for becoming a paralegal. <br />If paralegals had to take to complete a set curriculum of classes on specific topics -- so that the paralegal would have something approaching the breadth and depth of a lawyer's knowledge of the law -- that would deter some people from becoming paralegals. Learning a specific curriculum would cost more, thereby discouraging some people from working as a paralegal. Since it would cost more to complete such a curriculum, there would be fewer paralegals to help attorneys. With fewer paralegals, the price for their services go up. That would mean that a lawyer might have to decline an opportunity to represent a client, since having the paralegal do many law-related tasks would not be so cheap, when compared to having the lawyer doing the work. So, fewer people would have access to the knowledge and expertise of lawyers and paralegals. <br /> <br />Because states want to encourage the use of paralegals in the law office or government agency, they have not imposed certification standards which an individual must satisfy before that person can hold herself or himself out to the world as being a &quot;paralegal&quot;. <br /> <br />But aren't there certification programs in the field? <br /> <br />Yes. <br /> <br />The National Association of Legal Assistants, Inc. has created national standards and a test which allows a paralegal to be known as a Certified Legal Assistant. <br /> <br />To qualify to take the test, a test-taker must have done <b>any one (1)</b> of the following: <ul> <li>graduated from an American Bar Association-certified legal assistant program;</li> <br /> <br /> <li>earned an associate's degree or a bachelor's degree in legal assistant studies;</li> <br /> <br /> <li>earned a bachelor's degree in any field and has worked as a legal assistant for at least one year;</li> <br /> <br /> <li>earned a high school diploma or its equivalent <b>AND</b> has worked, under the supervision of a member of the Bar, at least for seven (7) years <b>AND</b> has completed at least twenty (20) hours of continuing legal education credit within the past two years before the date of the test</li> <br /> <br /> <li>[<b>NOTE:</b> fifteen (15) semester hours of classes in substantive law is considered to be the equivalent of a year's work a legal assistant];</li> <br /> <br /> <li>completed a post baccalaureate certificate program in legal assistant studies; or</li> <br /> <br /> <li>finished of a minimum of sixty (60) semester hours, fifteen (15) of which were in substantive law.</li> </ul>Over the course of two days, students could have to answers questions on <ul> <li>Analytic skills and abilities</li> <br /> <li>Communications</li> <br /> <li>Employment (specifically, Human Relations)</li> <br /> <li>Federal Law</li> <br /> <li>Federal Procedure</li> <br /> <li>Interviewing</li> <br /> <li>Legal Ethics</li> <br /> <li>Legal Research</li> <br /> <li>Legal Terminology</li> <br /> <li>Professional Judgement</li> </ul>During the test, students will have to complete demonstrate knowledge about substantive law regarding the American Legal System. They will also get to choose to answer questions in four (4) of the following substantive law topics: <br /> <br /> <ul> <li>Bankruptcy<br /></li> <li>Business Organizations (including corporations)</li> <br /> <li>Contract Law</li> <br /> <li>Criminal Law</li> <br /> <li>Criminal Procedure</li> <br /> <li>Domestic Relations (Family Law)</li> <br /> <li>Real Property (real estate)</li> <br /> <li>Regulatory (Administrative) Law</li> <br /> <li>Wills, Trusts and Estates</li> </ul>The NALA also offers examines in specialized topics of law, for those people who've already become CLAs. <br /> <br />For more information about NALA, contact them at: <br /> <br />National Association of Legal Assistants <br />1516 S. Boston, #200 <br />Tulsa, OK 74119 <br />(918) 587-6828 <br /> <br />or at <a href="http://www.nala.org">www.nala.org</a> <br /> <br />The National Federation of Paralegal Associations, Inc. offers the Paralegal Advanced Competency Examination (PACE). This test recognizes the fact that some paralegals do have more expertise in an area and that set a standard for evaluating that level of competency. It is also offered to states if they have chosen to regulate paralegals by requiring all paralegals to take this test if they which to work as a paralegal. This is a voluntary test, which could objectively establish the advanced competency of a paralegal. It generally seems to be a test designed for individuals who have already earned a bachelor's degree. <br /> <br />For more information about NFPA's PACE, contact them at: <br /> <br />National Federation of Paralegal Associations <br />P.O. Box 33108 <br />Kansas City, MO 64114 <br />(816) 941-4000 <br /> <br />or at <a href="http://www.paralegals.org">www.paralegals.org</a> <br /> <br />Again, a prospective paralegal doesn't have to complete such certification programs. National, professional paralegal organizations such as the NALA and the NFPA have instituted certification programs. By having passed such a certification process, the paralegal has demonstrated his or her competency according to the objective standards by these organizations. So, the paralegal can use the imprimatur of the certification organization to improve upon his or her chances for finding a job. But not every paralegal requires that depth of knowledge, as she or he may need only to focus on a particular topic, such as real estate or business law. <br /> <br />Other organizations interested in the topic of paralegal regulation and certification include the: <br /> <br />American Bar Association <br />750 N. Lakeshore Drive <br />Chicago, IL 60611 <br />(312) 988-5000 <br /> <br />or at <a href="http://www.abanet.org">www.abanet.org</a> <br /> <br />American Association for Paralegal Education <br />2965 Flowers Road South <br />Suite 105 <br />Atlanta, GA 30341 <br />(770) 452-9877 <br /> <br />or at <a href="http://www.aafpe.org">www.aafpe.org</a> <br /> <br /> <center> <a href="#top">Back to Top</a> </center> <br /> <a name="education">PARALEGAL</a> EDUCATION USING THE INTERNET <br /> <br />What does Internet-based education offer over classroom based education? <br /> <br />On-line education offers the best of classroom teaching without having to go to a classroom. As offered by the PLAT Institute, students will have a chance to study at their own pace. Motivated, self-directed learners will take command of the learning process, selecting the times when they want to learn. <br /> <br />What about having contact with a professor? <br /> <br />Through the use of web-based software, which allows students to meet in a &quot;virtual classroom&quot;, students can gain clarification and insight from the instructor on different topics of law. As in college, the faculty will be available, at posted hours during the week, for consultation. <br /> <br />PLAT students can also contact the instructor via e-mail. <br /> <br />How will students get a sense of how well they've come to understand the material? <br /> <br />With on-line testing, students get quicker feedback than in a classroom, since tests are also graded on-line. <br /> <br />Why not take such a program at a local institution? <br /> <br />This kind of on-line education cuts costs. There's no need for the creation of a physical campus, which means a drastic reduction in the expenses incurred to deliver the information. This accounts for the lower costs of this program as opposed to a program offered at a local institution. <br /> <br />At a local institution, students would have to take classes, at a fixed period of time over a specified number of weeks. Adhering to such a schedule often produces scheduling conflicts for the student. The local institutions will also have to maintain the buildings where the education takes place. Students usually would also have to spend time commuting to the local institution. <br /> <br />With on-line education, students get the material, work with the material at a pace which they feel is comfortable for them, and can always engage the instructor, one-on-one or in the &quot;virtual classroom&quot;, to get answers to their questions. <br /> <br />Can students communicate with one another in the &quot;virtual classroom&quot;? <br /> <br />They not only can meet there, but the Institute encourages that they meet to discuss the material in the courses. Students often improve their learning when teaching one another about the material. By answering another student's question, a student has to take a different perspective on the material. The student, in having to present the material, treats the material as something active (since they need to be able to explain it to another) rather than something passive (only when the student has to answer questions). <br /> <br />This interactivity among the students reinforces the competency which they develop as they study a subject, so that students come away from the program with active, instead of passive knowledge. Their discussions mean that they've learned how to trust their acquired knowledge, so the practice will prove to be quite useful when using this knowledge when working. <br /> <br />Does this mean that students have to meet in the &quot;virtual classroom&quot;? <br /> <br />No. The flexibility of on-line education means that students select the approach which feels the most comfortable and effective for them. Since all discussions in the &quot;classroom&quot; take place on-line, students may review the discussions at a later time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <center> <a href="#top">Back to Top</a> </center> <br />THE PARALEGAL AND LEGAL ASSISTANT TRAINING INSTITUTE (PLAT) <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="general">IN</a> GENERAL <br /> <br />How does the PLAT program differ from a pre-law program at a college or university? <br /> <br />If a university has created a pre-law program, the undergraduates would have to take courses in writing and analysis, perhaps on topics in political science, history and English. A pre-law program can prepare an undergraduate to have a more global view of the role of law in our society. Pre-law programs are designed to prepare the student for the intense level of study which students do while in law school <br /> <br />This paralegal program also provides a student with a broad understanding of the law. But the students in this program will focus on the more practical aspects of the law, instead of the theory that law students focus on. <br /> <br /> <br /> <center> <a href="#top">Back to Top</a> </center> <br /> <a name="grading">GRADING</a> AND EVALUATION <br /> <br />What kind of a testing and grading scheme will the Institute use with its students? <br /> <br />For all classes, students will have to complete an open-book, objective, twenty-question, quizzes (often, in the form of multiple-choice questions). Each quiz will be on each chapter of the text for that class. <br /> <br />While students will have to complete written assignments as part of their homework in the Legal Writing class, they will not need to submit it for review and grading. <br /> <br />Why do students need to take these kinds of tests? <br /> <br />Students need to take tests as a means of reinforcing the knowledge which they've just gained. Doing these timed exams as open-book exercises mean that students will be able to verify their answers. Students will also learn that it becomes impractical to expect to answer the questions within the time frame in which they are offered only by looking up the answers. The tests will require students to apply their knowledge. <br /> <br />So there's more to the open-book testing than just opening the book and answering the questions? <br /> <br />Yes. Prepare for these quizzes as though you're taking a closed book exam. Review the course material, paying attention to new terms introduced in the chapter, as well as to the concepts and topics for that chapter. By preparing in this way, students will have already started to organize the material. They will be engaging in active, instead of passive, learning. <br /> <br />Then what's the point to having these as open book quizzes? <br /> <br />By having access to the material in the text, students won't feel as though they have to memorize the material. Instead of just memorizing the material, the quizzes give students a chance to see how that material fits within a larger context. <br /> <br />How about grading? <br /> <br />Student grades will be issued on a scale of 0-100. With the objective testing, students will need to get 14 correct out of the twenty questions per chapter. <br /> <br />Does that mean that the quizzes bear some impact on earning the Certificate of Completion from the PLAT Institute? <br /> <br />Yes. The Institute wants to recognize the efforts of its students by setting minimum standards of quality. Students will need to average a grade of 70, on all the topics, in each class, before receiving the certificate. Any student who has less than a 70 average, by the time of completion of the class, will not get that certificate. <br /> <br />How does a student get that certificate if the student has, overall, an average below 70? <br /> <br />The student will need to retake so many classes as is necessary to bring up the student's average to a 70. Students may not want to or need to get the certificate of completion. Receipt of the Institute's certificate of completion occurs only after a student has demonstrated a certain level of competency about a title. <center> <a href="#top">Back to Top</a> </center> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </body> </html>

If they continue to smoke, they're at higher risk for a number of lung and heart diseases. If they try to quit, they experience a series of withdrawal symptoms (which are extremely unpleasant) such as weight gain, poor concentration, depression, irritability, and nicotine cravings. And it's not that many smokers don't try to quit. The problem is that quitting is so difficult. Statistics show that only about 2.5 percent of smokers successfully quit each year. </p> <div> If you truly want to stop smoking, you'll have to deal with the withdrawal symptoms. You must believe that not smoking outweighs all the difficulties you will encounter, or you're not in the right frame of mind to stop. This is a tough decision, and if you're having trouble deciding, a few options can help. </div> <h2>What Are My Options for Quitting?</h2> <div> There's no foolproof way to stop smoking, but you knew that already. You'll probably have to experiment with several different techniques before you stumble across one that works for you. </div> <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nicotine patches:</span> The patch has a fairly decent track recordbout twenty percent of people who use it have quit and remained smoke-free after six months. It has the convenience of being over-the-counter, but it's wise to consult a doctor before you start anyway, especially if you're pregnant. Possible side effects include skin rashes, nausea, headaches and stomach problems, and children should not come into contact with the patch at all. Most importantly, don't smoke while using the patch! Doing so can rocket your body's nicotine level up to toxic levels, which sort of defeats the purpose if you're quitting for health reasons!</p> <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nicotine gum:</span> Like patches, nicotine gum is available over-the-counter. Some people prefer it to the patch because chewing gum provides the oral stimulation that also comes from smoking. The goal is to have quit by the end of six months, but some ex-smokers chew it for longer periods. The taste may turn off some people.</p> <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Medication:</span> Certain antidepressants curb nicotine cravings. Obviously, choosing to explore this route requires the involvement and consent of your doctor, who can explain the advantages and disadvantages of using medication to combat smoking.</p> <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hypnosis:</span> One of the biggest advantages of hypnosis is its non-medicinal approacht can be combined with patches or medication without fear of unwanted physical side effects. It may prove to be what you need to quit, or it may give you enough of a push to let the more physical methods work.</p> <div> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cold Turkey:</span> Ah, the macho way to quit! Just say no! Unfortunately, only about three percent of smokers who use this method succeed. Your chances of success rise if you have a good support group, however. Using a scheduled reduction plan, where you slowly reduce cigarette consumption, has also proven itself more effective than just quitting &quot;cold turkey.&quot; </div> <h2>After You Quit Smoking</h2> <div> If it's not one thing, it's another. With smoking, you've either got the health problems of smoking or the withdrawal symptoms of quitting. If you've decided to quit smoking, good for you! Here's what you can look forward to. </div> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Weight gain:</span> Smoking is an oral fixation. People who quit usually find something else to do with their restless mouth, such as eating. This can lead to weight gain (and water retention), but don't worry. The average weight gain is about 6 to 8 pounds, but don't let that weigh you down. A few trips to the gym and you'll be back to your smoking weight! </li> <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cravings:</span> Nicotine is a drug. You're going to crave it for a long time (years). Try and find something to fight your cravingsike caffeine! Just kidding, try something like sugar-free gum, instead. </li> <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other withdrawal symptoms:</span> The first week is most likely the worst. When the nicotine is completely eliminated from your system (about 2 to 3 days after your last cigarette), you're going to find out what &quot;a kick in the head&quot; feels like. </li> <li> <div> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Will you ever feel better? </span>Let's just say you won't feel worsehat is unless you find breathing through a tracheostoma a step up. </div></li> </ul> <div> &nbsp; </div> <div> &nbsp; </div> <!-- end article insert --> </div> <div class="article_comments"> <!-- comments section --> <form name="commentform" id="commentform" action="/articles/body/quit-smoking.php" method="POST" style="margin:0px;"> <input type="hidden" name="delid" value="" /> <input type="hidden" name="parentid" value="" /> <input type="hidden" name="formid" value="" /> <input type="hidden" name="addcomment" value="" /> <a name="comments"></a> <div style="padding:10px; margin-top:10px; border:1px silver solid;"> <div style="background: transparent url('/images/comments-small.png') top left no-repeat; height:50px;"> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td style="padding-left:60px; padding-top: 30px; font-size:10px;"><b>Share your thoughts...</b></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <br /> <a name="commentform"></a> <a href="javascript:toggle('99999')"><b>Comment on this Article</b></a>&nbsp; <img src="/VChost/dnarw.gif" alt="" border="0" /> <br /> <br /> <!-- comment form --> <div id="c99999" style="border:1px silver solid; padding:10px; display:none;"> <div style="background-color:#FFF; padding:6px;"> <table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td align="right">Name:</td> <td><input type="text" class="formelem" name="uname0" id="uname0" value="" size="" maxlength="64" style="width:340px;" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right">Validate:</td> <td> <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td style="padding-top:1px;"><img src="/VChost/image-verify.php" alt="" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> <td><input type="text" class="formelem" name="code_check0" id="code_check0" value="" size="8" maxlength="6" />&nbsp;</td> <td>&lt;- Type these numbers</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right">Email:</td> <td><input type="text" class="formelem" name="uemail0" id="uemail0" value="" size="" maxlength="64" style="width:340px;" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right" valign="top">Comment:</td> <td><textarea name="ucomment0" id="ucomment0" class="formelem" rows="cols=" style="border:1px silver solid; height:60px; width:340px;"></textarea></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right">&nbsp;</td> <td> <input type="text" class="formelem" name="spamCatcher" id="spamCatcher" value="" size="" maxlength="" style="display:none" /> <input class="formelem" type="button" value="Add Comment" onclick="do_addcomment(0,0)" /> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div> <!-- end input comment --> <div style="height:25px; padding-top:10px;"> <div style="float:left; font-size:14px; font-weight:bold;"> 9 Comments(s) </div> <div style="float:right; padding-top:2px;"> <a href="?corder=DESC"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Newest First</span></a>&nbsp;|&nbsp; <a href="?corder=ASC"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Oldest First</span></a>&nbsp; </div> </div> <div style="padding:6px; margin-bottom:10px; border:1px silver solid;"> <div style="padding-left:0px; padding-top:0px;"> <div style="width:40px; float:left;"> <img src="/images/commenter.png" alt="" border="0" /> </div> <div> <div> Posted by <b>Jeff</b> </div> <div class="dateline"> December 13, 2008 at 02:53 AM </div> <div style="padding-top:8px; line-height:17px;"> 6 days and my lungs actually hurt.I have not coughed any crap out of my lungs and i do not nor have i ever had a coughing issue.Smoked for 32 years,should'nt something be happening to make me think i am getting this crap out of my system?

Its easy... <br />I smoked from the age of 13 till 39 about 2 packs a day. I was always nervious about how &quot;hard&quot; it was going to be, and had heard that it was tougher then quiting heroin : O Long story short, I decided to focus on the gross feeling I sometimes got when I smoked (like the last drag of a smoke ya dident need, YUK!). For some reason that kind of green feeling/taste I just kept in my mind, and i thought of it every time I wanted a smoke. It was kinda like reinforcing in my mind that I hated smoking and that I definatly dident need them. Then, I usually started thinking of all the reasons I wanted to quit, and that I was a complete wimp if I couldent do it. I realized it was ALL in my mind. That, and it really wasent all that tough to not smoke. As a matter of fact it was easy when I related something bad (green feeling)with smoking rather then good. Trust me, I feel sooooooo much better now on so many levels that I cant begin to list them all here. Just know that in the end it\'s well worth it and it\'s really not that tough. ITS JUST ALL IN HOW YOU LOOK AT IT. <br />GOOD LUCK ALL. AND REMEMBER, ITS EASY. : ) <br /> <br /> </div> <a name="comment341"></a> <div style="background-color:#EEE; height:26px; border-top:2px silver solid; margin-top:5px; padding-top:5px;"> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td>&nbsp;<img src="/images/comment.png" alt="" border="0" style="margin-bottom:-4px; margin-right:8px;" /><a href="javascript:toggle('341');">Reply to <b>ByTor</b></a></td> <td> &nbsp; </td> <td align="right"><img src="/images/object.png" alt="" border="0" style="margin-bottom:-4px; margin-right:8px;" /><a href="mailto:abuse@morefocus.com?subject=Comment Abuse on mindbodyfocused.com&amp;body=I found this comment to be abusive: http://www.mindbodyfocused.com/articles/body/quit-smoking.php?">Report this Post</a>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id="c341" style="display:none;"> <div style="background-color:#FFF; padding:6px;"> <table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td align="right">Name:</td> <td><input type="text" class="formelem" name="uname341" id="uname341" value="" size="" maxlength="64" style="width:340px;" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right">Validate:</td> <td> <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td style="padding-top:1px;"><img src="/VChost/image-verify.php" alt="" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> <td><input type="text" class="formelem" name="code_check341" id="code_check341" value="" size="8" maxlength="6" />&nbsp;</td> <td>&lt;- Type these numbers</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right">Email:</td> <td><input type="text" class="formelem" name="uemail341" id="uemail341" value="" size="" maxlength="64" style="width:340px;" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right" valign="top">Answer:</td> <td><textarea name="ucomment341" id="ucomment341" class="formelem" rows="cols=" style="border:1px silver solid; height:60px; width:340px;"></textarea></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right">&nbsp;</td> <td> <input type="text" class="formelem" name="spamCatcher" id="spamCatcher" value="" size="" maxlength="" style="display:none" /> <input class="formelem" type="button" value="Add Comment" onclick="do_addcomment(341,341)" /> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="r341" style="display:block;"> </div> </div> <div style="padding:6px; margin-bottom:10px; border:1px silver solid;"> <div style="padding-left:0px; padding-top:0px;"> <div style="width:40px; float:left;"> <img src="/images/commenter.png" alt="" border="0" /> </div> <div> <div> Posted by <b>ton</b> </div> <div class="dateline"> October 05, 2008 at 09:02 AM </div> <div style="padding-top:8px; line-height:17px;"> wanted to stop smoking for a long long time. tried once but unfortunately was not successful because of the widrawal symptoms I experienced for 3 weeks.. want to try again tom.. hope this time I'll succeed..

I had my last one last night; took 3 drags and butted it out. It tasted gross after not smoking all day. This is my 2nd quit-last year I quit for a month until I stupidly picked em back up on a drunken night out (doh!) The info was good-but for some people I think &quot;cold turkey's&quot; the only way to go. </div> <a name="comment15"></a> <div style="background-color:#EEE; height:26px; border-top:2px silver solid;

Students who are currently enrolled in four-year degree programs may find coursework at their schools that can prepare them for work as a paralegal. This, however, is not the only approach that parties interested in a legal career can pursue. There are very few schools in the United States that specialize in paralegal training and are accredited and ABA approved. The Center For Advanced Legal Studies is one of these schools.</p> <h2>Choosing among Accredited Paralegal Schools</h2> <p>There are many approvals that schools may possess if they offer training for legal assistants. Some schools may be approved by the American Bar Association, ensuring that they are providing the appropriate training for students to assume the roles of legal assistants in the future. Paralegal schools may also have the approval of state education boards. In addition, paralegal schools may be approved by the United States Department of Education. <span class="ishmcallout">Students attending degree programs at accredited paralegal schools may be eligible for financial assistance.</span></p> <p>In addition to offering associate's degrees for paralegals, some schools also offer certificates in paralegal education. These certificate programs can often be completed in less than a year, allowing students to finish them while still working or taking care of their families.</p> <p>The <a href="http://www.paralegal.edu/">Center For Advanced Legal Studies</a> offers coursework approved by the American Bar Association and the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
