The automotive industry should be given credit for having organized recycling early on.&nbsp; The recycling process is simple and 70 percent of the battery’s weight is reusable lead.&nbsp;As a result, over 50 percent of the lead supply comes from recycled batteries.&nbsp;Other battery types are not being returned as readily as lead acid, and several organizations are working on programs to make collection of spent batteries more convenient. Only 20 to 40 percent of cellular phone and consumer batteries are currently recycled.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main objective for recycling batteries is to prevent hazardous materials from entering landfills. Lead acid and nickel-cadmium batteries are of special concern, and although Li-ion is less harmful, the aim is to include all batteries in the recycling programs.&nbsp;Do not store old lead acid batteries in households where children play. Simply touching the lead poles can be harmful. Read more about the <a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/health_concerns">Health Concerns with Batteries</a>.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even though they are environmentally unfriendly, lead acid batteries continue to hold a strong market niche. Wheeled mobility and UPS systems could not run as economically if it were not for this reliable battery. NiCd also continues to hold a critical position among rechargeable batteries. Large flooded NiCds start the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) of commercial airplanes and power sightseeing boats in rivers of larger cities, pollution-free.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Toxic batteries will continue to be with us for a while longer because we have no practical alternatives. There is nothing wrong in using these batteries as long as we properly dispose of them. Europe banned NiCds in consumer products because there is a suitable replacement, the NiMH battery. Controlling the disposal of NiCds from consumer products is difficult because many users do not know that the retiring equipment includes this battery. The long-term environmental damage if the world’s NiCds were improperly disposed of could be devastating.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let’s look at what happens when NiCds are carelessly disposed of in landfills. The metallic cylinder of the cell eventually begins to corrode and the cadmium gradually dissolves, seeping into the water supply. Once such contamination begins, the authorities have few options to stop the carnage. Our oceans already show traces of cadmium (along with aspirin, penicillin and antidepressants) but scientists are not certain of its origin. Regulatory discipline will lead to a cleaner environment for the next generations.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nickel-metal-hydride batteries contain nickel and electrolyte, which are considered semi-toxic. If no disposal service is available in an area, individual NiMH batteries can be discarded with other household waste. When accumulating 10 or more batteries, the user should consider disposing of the packs in a secure waste landfill. The better alternative is bringing the spent batteries to a neighborhood drop-off bin for recycling.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Primary lithium batteries contain metallic lithium that reacts violently when in contact with moisture and the batteries must be disposed of appropriately. If thrown in the landfill in a charged state, heavy equipment operating on top could crush the cases and the exposed lithium would cause a fire. Landfill fires are difficult to extinguish and can burn for years underground. Before recycling, apply a full discharge to consume the lithium content. Non-rechargeable lithium batteries are used in military combat, as well as watches, hearing aids and memory backup. Li-ion for cell phones and laptops do not contain metallic lithium.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In North America,Toxco and Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation (RBRC) collect spent batteries and recycle them. While Toxco has its own recycling facilities, RBRC is in charge of collecting batteries and sending them to recycling organizations. Toxco in Trail, British Columbia, claims to be the only company in the world that recycles large lithium batteries. They receive spent batteries from oil drilling in Nigeria, Indonesia and other places. Toxco also recycles retired lithium batteries from the Minuteman missile silos and tons of Li-ion from the war in Iraq. Other divisions at Toxco recycle nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal-hydride, lead, mercury, alkaline and more.</font></p> <p> Europe and Asia are also active in recycling spent batteries. Among other recycling companies, Sony and Sumitomo Metal in Japan and Unicore in Belgium have developed technology to retrieve cobalt and other precious metals from spent lithium ion batteries. The raw material lithium can also be retrieved and re-used repeatedly.

Collection centers place lead acid, nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal-hydride and lithium‑ion into designated drums, sacks or boxes. Battery recyclers claim that if a steady stream of batteries, sorted by chemistry, were available at no charge, recycling would be profitable.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The recycling process generally begins by removing the combustible material, such as plastics and insulation, with a gas-fired thermal oxidizer. The plant’s scrubber eliminates the polluting particles created by a burning process before releasing them into the atmosphere. This leaves the clean and naked cells with their valuable metal content. The cells are then chopped into small pieces and heated until the metal liquefies. Non-metallic substances are burned off; leaving a black slag on top that a slag arm removes. The alloys settle according to weight and are skimmed off like cream from raw milk while in liquid form.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cadmium is relatively light and vaporizes at high temperatures. In a process that appears like a pan of water boiling over, a fan blows the cadmium vapor into a large tube cooled with water mist, and the vapors condense to produce cadmium that is 99.95&nbsp;percent pure.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some recyclers do not separate the metals on site but pour the liquid metals directly into what the industry refers to as “pigs” (65 pounds, 24kg) or “hogs” (2,000 pounds, 746kg). Other battery recyclers use the 7-pound nuggets (3.17kg). The pigs, hogs and nuggets are then shipped to metal recovery plants where they are used to produce nickel, chromium and iron for stainless steel and other high-end products.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Toxco uses liquid nitrogen to freeze lithium-based batteries before shredding, crushing and removal of the lithium, as well as other battery components. The lithium is dissolved in a solution to make the metal non-reactive and is sold for producing lubricating greases. Similarly, the cobalt is separated, collected and sold.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Battery recycling is energy-intensive, and it takes 6 to 10 times more energy to reclaim metals from recycled batteries as it does to produce the materials through other means, including mining. Let’s explore who pays for the recycling of batteries.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each country imposes their own rules and fees to make recycling feasible. In North America, some recycling plants invoice on weight, and the rates vary according to chemistry. Nickel-metal-hydride yields the best return, as recycling produces enough nickel to pay for the process. The highest recycling fees apply to nickel-cadmium and lithium‑ion, because the demand for cadmium is low and lithium‑ion contains little in retrievable metal.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rather than calculate the cost according to battery chemistry, some countries deal in tonnage. The flat cost to recycle a ton of batteries is $1,000 to $2,000, and Europe hopes to achieve a cost per ton of $300. Ideally, this would include transportation, but moving and handling the goods is expected to double the overall cost. To simplify transportation, Europe is setting up several smaller processing plants in strategic geographic locations.</font></p> <p> <font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Manufacturers, agencies and governments still must provide subsidies to support the battery recycling programs. This is underwritten by a tax added to each manufactured cell. RBRC receives funding from such a program.</font><br /> &nbsp;</p> <table border="0" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" style="width: 550px; "> <tbody> <tr> <td style="background-color: rgb(224, 224, 224); "> <br /> <strong>Caution:</strong></td> <td style="background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238); "> Under no circumstances should batteries be incinerated, as fire can cause an explosion.

If one asks a crosssection of members of the general public what they know about the beliefs ofJehovah's Witnesses, then usually the most popular answer will be to do withtheir refusal to accept blood transfusions.<p>The purpose of this report is to provide an alternative (and I hopebalanced) view of the question of blood transfusions and Jehovah'sWitnesses. There are many problems when a blood transfusion is needed,<b>especially in the case of a child.</b> There are further complications ifone parent is a Witness and the other is not.</p><p>I therefore researched, collated and wrote this initially for the purpose ofexplaining to a Witness just why I may give permission for <b>my</b>children to have a blood transfusion, if I consider it to be the wisestcourse of action, and having listened to and evaluated the potential risksand benefits. The document has grown and I hope that it may be of assistanceto others. Its research proved to be quite a (sad) eye opener for me. </p><p>When a Jehovah's Witness contemplates the refusal of a blood transfusion,then both they <b>and</b> their fellow Witness family and friends should beaware of just how their organisation has arrived at its rules regardingblood. I use the word &quot;rules&quot; deliberately, knowing that a Witness willconsider the refusal of blood (including transfusions) to be a strictcommand from God. The evidence suggests that is not quite that simple. AWitness no longer has to repeat the old established response:</p><p></p> <ul> <b> &quot;no blood or blood products please&quot;</b> </ul><p>Blood is not simply taken from one individual and later given to another.This is accepted by the Witnesses organisation and the rules and regulationsgoverning blood products and Jehovah's Witnesses have changed over theyears. </p><p><b></b></p><h4><b>Choice</b></h4>If a person does not wish to accept a blood fraction transfusion during thecourse of a routine planned operation then so be it. If that person finds asurgeon that agrees to operate, then that is their decision. <p>A Sunday Telegraph article in December 1994 reported claims that &quot;manysurgeons had a far too cavalier attitude to the use of blood&quot; and &quot;if bloodwere a drug, it would not get a licence&quot;. The article was prompted by aHepatitis C scare. In early 1995 it was widely reported in the U.K. pressand TV that up to 3000 persons may be at risk from hepatitis C from bloodthat had not been properly screened and treated in the 1980s. Persons werefinally being contacted by the health authorities. At the time of writing(1995) it is being alleged that there had been a &quot;cover up&quot; on the part ofthe authorities. </p><p>This is worrying information indeed. Enough to possibly make one investigatefurther, or to even think twice before accepting a non essential bloodtransfusion as part of a routine medical procedure, especially if there wereacceptable and available alternatives. </p><p>However, this document is primarily concerned with &quot;danger to life&quot; - thesituation where the medical opinion requires that a transfusion is essentialand any delay (in order to seek alternatives) is an unacceptable risk to thepatient</p><p>Even in the case of the majority of routine operations and surgicalprocedures not normally needing any blood, there is always a chance that acomplication will arise, (haemorrhaging for example) necessitating anunexpected transfusion. That is why many surgeons are reluctant to &quot;go inwith half a tool-kit&quot; because of a &quot;no blood&quot; request by the patient or thepatient's guardian. Doctors and Surgeons are under oath to provide the bestpossible care that they can in the given circumstances. Time is often acrucial factor. They do their best with the information, knowledge andequipment at their disposal. </p><p>Witnesses need to be fully aware of how their organisation has developedit's beliefs An average Jehovah's Witness will have attended many meetingsevery week where regularly their organisation - the <b>WBTS</b>'s view ofwhat the Bible says about blood will have been emphasised. Rarely, even forthe purposes of balance, are they shown the &quot;other side of the fence&quot; in anydetail. Never is <b>anything critical</b> of their position ever published.If a Witness is to see an alternative viewpoint on the outcome of theirposition with regard to blood, it will usually come from reading newspaperreports about the resultant tragedies. </p><p><b>When personal disaster strikes</b>, and the issue of blood arises, theWitness will have an automatic reaction that causes them to refuse blood,for either themselves or their children. It is built up and repeated to themover a number of years; their organisation (WBTS) regularly publishesinformation, reports and experiences connected with the subject of blood andmedicine. The Witness will consider his or her stand to be 100% consistentwith the teachings of the Bible and certainly not negotiable. Others in hisor her congregation, usually the elders or family and friends, willencourage them not to accept any transfusion. </p><p>The following quotations and comments are fully sourced wherever possible,so that they may be checked. First a few statements that are not disputed inany way. Many Witnesses' arguments dwell on these points at great length.</p><p></p> <ul> It is not questioned that a blood fraction transfusion (along with mostmedical procedures) carries risk. It is probably correct that that blood is overused routinely. Jehovah's Witnesses, in allowing themselves to used as 'Guinea pigs' havehelped medical advancement in the use of non-blood treatments. Many of thesetreatments do have advantages over the blood alternatives. Medical knowledgeis, after all, constantly progressing In some cases, transfusions have been forced on (usually the children of)Witnesses, and the patient has still died. </ul>For decades now blood transfusions have usually been a transfusion of a<i>blood fraction</i>, which is usually one of the component parts of theblood. Whole blood (as donated) is considered to be a valuable commodity.For instance, an anaemic patient may require red cells only, rather than theplasma. Another patient could require platelets, a burned patient mayrequire albumin, and yet another may require the clotting factors found inthe blood. Other products such as vaccinations and serums are sometimesmanufactured from specific types of blood. <p><b></b></p><h3><b>The Organisation </b></h3><b> (Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society - WBTS)</b><p>The Governing Body of the organisation are located at Brooklyn, U.S.A. Itis<b> they</b> that have effectively decided what will and will not beallowed, and also what is currently &quot;left to the individual conscience&quot; of aWitness. If a particular treatment is NOT allowed, then accepting it., asWitnesses know, will lead to disfellowshiping from the congregation. </p><p>The ex-Witnesses' family, friends and acquaintances will then be<b>forbidden to even greet that one or even to say &quot;hello&quot;. Thedisfellowshiped Witness is completely shunned and cut off from their formersocial circle, probably in it's entirety. His former friends are told to&quot;hate&quot; him. (September 1981 Watchtowers) This practice has a strong tendencyto &quot;keep Witnesses in line&quot;.</b></p><p>A Witness is not allowed to disagree with any of the organisation'steachings or rulings. The organisation make the claim that they are &quot;God's<b>sole</b> visible channel of communication on earth today&quot;. A bigresponsibility for the leaders of that organisation, you will no doubtagree. However, if past errors are pointed out to them, they will remind usthat they do not claim to be &quot;inspired&quot; or &quot;infallible&quot;. Yet, on the otherhand, they regularly speak of &quot;revealed truths&quot; and regularly claim that Godis exclusively using them, as &quot;God's Mother Organisation&quot;. Also theorganisation will not tolerate any disagreement or dissension on anydoctrine, however minor. Many non - Witnesses cannot comprehend thesediscrepancies, and they go unexplained.</p><p>Everyone is responsible for their own actions. (Rev 20:13) No one can hidebehind ANY earthly &quot;organisation&quot;, maybe hoping that &quot;if anything is wrongit will be put right later&quot;. </p><p>Most Witnesses spend literally thousands of hours telling others to examinetheir religion or personal beliefs. If you are a Witness, just once, pleasespend an hour or so examining just one aspect of your own. The Watchtower1st May 1994 page 16 says </p><p></p> <blockquote> <b>Millions of people have become Jehovah's Witnesses. All of them should be well informed about the history of the organisation with which they are associated.</b> </blockquote><p>Very true. The current situation then regarding blood and blood products:</p><p><b></b></p><h4><b>Present Position</b></h4><b>ALLOWED (subject to personal conscience):</b> Albumin, Immune Globulin'setc., Factors 8 &amp; 9 for haemophiliacs. Serums containing &quot;minute fractionsof blood&quot;. Diversion and treatment of blood by dialysis machines, heart lungmachines etc. The machine must be non blood primed and stay connected - atype of elongation of the circulatory system. <p><b>NOT ALLOWED (regardless of personal conscience): </b> Whole blood,Plasma, Red or White (leukocyte) blood cells, Platelets, any storage ofblood, including ones own.</p><p>(Publications quoted are all published by the WBTS (Watchtower Bible &amp; TractSociety unless otherwise stated)</p><p></p><p></p> <hr /><b><h3>History of the Witnesses and the Issue of Blood.</h3></b><p>It is important to examine the history of the subject because the averageWitness will think that their governing organisation has been consistent. inits teachings about blood and associated subjects.</p><p><b></b></p><h3><b><a name="1909">1909</a></b></h3>C.T. Russell, (the founder of the religion in the 1870's) commented on Acts15. This passage speaks of abstaining from certain things including theeating of blood. <b>It is the main scripture on which Witnesses base theirpresent standpoint.</b> Russell said:<p>It was not intimated that abstinence from these things would MAKE THEMCHRISTIANS, for nothing but faith in Christ and consecration to him andendeavour to walk in his steps could constitute them Christians... Thethings here recommended were necessary to a preservation of the fellowshipof the &quot;body&quot; composed of Jews and Gentiles... A similar thought attaches tothe prohibition of the use of blood. To the Jew it was forbidden... Theseprohibitions had never come to the Gentiles, because they had never beenunder the Law Covenant; but so deeply rooted were the Jewish ideas on thesubject that it was necessary for the peace of the church that the Gentilesshould observe this matter also (Watchtower, 15 April 1909, p. 4374).</p><p>Most Christians today (other than Jehovah's Witnesses) would tend to broadlyagree with Pastor Russell's understanding of the context of Acts 15. More ofthe scriptural side in section 2. </p><p></p><p>The Modern day Jehovah's Witnesses beliefs regarding blood transfusionsactually started with the question of vaccinations. They had always refusedto <b>eat</b> blood, such as blood sausage, because of their understandingof God's command to Noah in Genesis chapter 9, which they believe forbidsthe eating of animals that had not been bled.</p><p>So it started then in 1931 with the question of vaccinations:</p><p><b></b></p><h3><b><a name="1931">1931</a></b></h3><h4><b>VACCINATIONS</b></h4> <blockquote> Vaccination is a direct violation of the Everlasting Covenant that God made with Noah after the flood. (Golden Age, 4 February 1931, p. 293). </blockquote><p>The same article linked the eating of blood with demonism and sexualimmorality.</p><p></p> <blockquote> ..much looseness of our day along sexual lines may be traceable to the easy and continual violation of the divine commands to keep human and animal blood apart from each other. With cells of foreign blood racing through his veins a man is not normal, not himself, but lacks the poise and balance which makes for self control. (Ibid Page 293) </blockquote><b><h3><a name="1935">1935</a></h3></b> <blockquote> As vaccination is a direct injection of animal matter in the blood stream vaccination is a direct violation of the <i>law </i>of Jehovah God (Golden Age, WBTS, 24 April 1935, p. 465). </blockquote><b><h4>SMALLPOX</h4></b>Smallpox was a major problem. It should be remembered that smallpox had amortality rate of up to 40%. In 1921 their were 100,000 cases in the(civilised) U.S. alone. By 1953 there were none. The vaccination programtherefore saved literally thousands of lives world wide. <p>A Witness named William Cetnar made a detailed investigation into smallpoxvaccinations and actually discovered that the vaccination was notmanufactured from blood at all. He submitted his findings to theheadquarters of the organisation. He received no acknowledgement, but inApril 1952 the society finally published the reversal of the vaccinationban.</p><p>Smallpox is highly contagious. How many died (or infected others) as aresult of the organisation's &quot;rules at the time&quot;, we can have no way ofknowing. Children were unable to start school without a smallpox vaccinationcertificate. There were reports of sympathetic doctors actually scarringchildren's skin and then issuing a false certificate. Witnesses could notleave or enter countries. Witnesses in prison were solitarily confined. AnIncredible situation. </p><p>A modern Witness will no doubt see the change regarding vaccinations as anexample of God &quot;gradually revealing or making things clearer&quot;. This is theusual explanation of doctrinal change. <i> </i>(It does not however explainwhy some doctrines later revert to the original thinking) </p><p>Anyway, because a Witnesses is obliged to obey all of their organisation'spresent teachings at any one point in time, they are, by default,<b>actually blaming God in the above example</b>. God wants them to followany present teaching, even if it later proves to be in error. No doubt itwould therefore have been preferable for God to have made up His mind aboutvaccinations earlier?</p><p>Unfortunately, at that time, a senior member of the Headquarters of theorganisation and the editor of the Golden Age magazine (the forerunner tothe Consolation and now Awake magazine) was Clayton Woodcock. He hated themodern American medical advances. In other Golden Age articles he denied thegerm theory of disease, instead blaming many illnesses on aluminium cookwareof all things. He referred to smallpox vaccinations as<b> &quot;the filthy customof injecting animal puss into the system&quot;!</b> (As illustrated here)</p><p>Many cartoons appeared in the Golden Age magazine showing things such aspiles of pock marked babies, damaged by vaccinations. Other cartoonsdepicted &quot;dope doctors&quot; holding syringes labelled &quot;puss&quot;. </p><p><b></b></p><h3><b><a name="1945">1945</a></b></h3><h4><b>TRANSFUSIONS</b></h4><br />The organisations published view of blood transfusions started in 1945. Theywere a bit slow off the mark because transfusions had been an establishedmedical procedure for well over 20 years, and the first large blood bank hadstarted in Chicago in 1937.<p>WT, 1 July, pp. 198-201, stated that </p> <blockquote> &quot;blood transfusions were pagan and God-dishonouring&quot;. All blood and blood products and fractions were included in this ruling. </blockquote><p>Incidentally, in the book Faith on the March by A H Macmillan -Prentice-Hall 1957 - one of the few &quot;approved&quot; non- WBTS publications, theauthor relates his experiences while visiting some 4,500 Jehovah's Witnessesin prison, (as consciencous objectors) after the second World War. They wererefusing vaccination and were put in solitary confinement. The author, asenior officer of the organisation, spent over two hours trying to persuadethem to accept the vaccination. Page 188-190;</p><p></p> <blockquote> ...Some of our boys in one prison considered this the same as blood transfusions and refused to submit... </blockquote><p>I wonder where they got that idea from? They had not come up with theidea independently. Anyway, they eventually accepted the vaccinations andwhen asked by the warder how he managed it the author replied</p><p></p> <blockquote> &quot;Well, I simply showed them their responsibility and pointed out that if evil resulted the government would be held responsible&quot;, said Macmillan. &quot;We told them that, too but it didn't convince them&quot;, said the warder. &quot;The difference was, I talked the Bible to them, and that Book Jehovah's Witnesses obey&quot;. &quot;Yes, I'm beginning to believe that,&quot; was the Warden's (incredible) conclusion. </blockquote><p>As the concept of vaccination is obviously not referred to anywhere inthe Bible, I can only conclude that it was the fact that the<i><b>organisation</b> had, since the late 1930s, quietly now acceptedvaccinations </i>that was really responsible for changing those men's mind.<i> </i>Regrettably, the organisation had not yet chosen to specificallypublish this fact that they could now accept the &quot;filthy animal puss&quot;.</p><p></p><h3><b><a name="1949">1949</a></b></h3><h4><b>ORGAN TRANSPLANTS</b></h4>Organ transplants are pronounced as acceptable. The December 22 Awakecarried an article with the catchy title &quot;Spare Parts for Your Body&quot;. Bloodwas said to be wrong but organ and bone transplants were &quot;wonders of modernsurgery&quot;<p><b></b></p><h3><b><a name="1952">1952</a></b></h3>Vaccinations, such as smallpox discussed above are now published asofficially allowed (in a letter dated 15 April).<p><b></b></p><h3><b><a name="1958">1958</a></b></h3><h4><b>Blood serums considered</b></h4> <blockquote> &quot;Are we to consider the injection of serums such as diphtheria toxin antitoxin and blood fractions such as gamma globulin into the blood stream for the purpose of building up resistance to disease as the same as drinking blood or taking in of blood or blood plasma by transfusion? No, it does not seem necessary that we put the two in the same category... prohibition in the scriptures is in connection with taking it as food, and so it is as a nutrient that we are concerned with its being forbidden... The injection of antibodies into the blood in a vehicle of blood serum or the use of blood fractions to create such antibodies is not the same as taking blood, either by mouth or by transfusion, as a nutrient to build up the body's vital forces. While God did not intend for any man to contaminate his blood stream by vaccines, serums or blood fractions, doing so does not seem to be included in God's express will forbidding blood as food. It would therefore be a matter of individual judgement whether one accepted such types of medication or not&quot;. (WT, 15 September 1958, p. 575). </blockquote><p>It is interesting to note that this is the basic objection to bloodtransfusion, that a transfusion is the same as eating blood, taking it intothe body as a nutrient or food. Another phrase, later introduced by theorganisation and currently preferred in connection with the transfusion is&quot;to sustain life or strengthen one&quot; Later, the phrases were ofteninterchanged, depending on what the particular argument being put forthrequired. </p><p>The 1st August Watchtower had a &quot;Question from Readers&quot; on page 478 askingwhether a sister member of the &quot;anointed remnant&quot; (a special class ofWitness who believes that he or she will go to heaven) who accepts a bloodtransfusion should then be allowed to celebrate the &quot;Memorial&quot; [a Witnessremembrance of the death of Christ where only the &quot;anointed&quot; partake of thesymbolic bread and wine] The answer given is yes. &quot;Although she should beviewed as immature,... you have no right to bar this sister from celebratingthe Lord's Evening Meal&quot; This attitude would only last for 2 years - see1961 below.</p><p><b></b></p><h3><b><a name="1959">1959</a></b></h3><b><br /><h4>The &quot;pouring out&quot; of blood</h4></b><p>Blood has to be &quot;poured out&quot;;</p><p></p> <blockquote> According to the method of handling blood prescribed by the Bible, blood when taken from a body was poured out on the ground as water and covered over with dust... This is because life is in the blood and such shed blood is held sacred before Jehovah God... Consequently, the removal of one's blood, storing it and later putting it back into the SAME person, would be a violation of the Scriptural principles that govern the handling of blood (WT, 15 October 1959, p. 640). </blockquote><p>They fail to point out that they are quoting from Lev 17:13,14 which waspart of the old law to Israel, and (as they will agree) not applicable toChristians. However, the old law to the Israelites is often quoted as&quot;indicative of God's view&quot; on a subject especially when it tends to supporta current doctrine. That same law's ban on shellfish or pigs, for example,is not quoted as &quot;indicative of God's view&quot;.</p><p><b></b></p><h3><b><a name="1961">1961</a></b></h3><h4><b>Punishment</b></h4>Having a blood or blood product transfusion was now made punishable bydisfellowshiping (or excommunication.) (WT, 15 January 1961, pp. 63-64)<p>It was only since 1952 under the then president N.H. Knorr thatdisfellowshiping became quite common. Until then, as long as they were notdisrupting the congregation, Witnesses were sometimes able to do things theorganisation had ruled against wthout official penalty. If discovered, otherWitnesses would probably not view them as a mature Witness, but until 1952,it sometimes didn't go much further. Since 1961 many have beendisfellowshiped for accepting blood or blood products. Some have beendisfellowshiped literally on their deathbed. Their former friends and familywill not (or should not) then even attend the funeral.</p><p><b></b></p><h4><b>Organ Donation</b></h4><p>Organ donation is a matter for personal conscience:</p> <blockquote> Donating organs after death is a matter of conscience. ...No scriptural principles are involved... It is therefore something that each individual must decide for himself... no one else should criticise him.. (WT, 1 August 1961, p. 480). </blockquote><b><h4>Blood and Personality</h4></b>The 1/9/61 Watchtower on page 564 lends support to the amazing view that <b>personality traits could be transmitted by blood transfusion </b>- that theimpulses to commit suicide, murder and stealing are in the blood and couldtherefore be transferred to another person accepting a transfusion, i.e. apersonality transfusion.<p><b></b></p><h3><b><a name="1963">1963</a></b></h3><h4><b>Blood fractions &amp; serums (again)</b></h4><p>A reversal. Any fraction of blood is now considered as a nutrient and isnot to be used in any medical treatment. Serums are therefore ruled outagain.</p><p></p> <blockquote> ... for it is not just whole blood but anything that is derived from blood and used to sustain life or strengthen one that comes under this principle (WT, 15 February 1963, p. 124). </blockquote><p>Compare this with the <a href="#1958">1958</a> statement a mere 5 yearspreviously. Evidently blood derived vaccinations do not strengthen one inthe face of disease because they are still OK. Serums are not. Note alsothe use of &quot;sustain life or strengthen one&quot;. </p><p><b></b></p><h3><b><a name="1964">1964</a></b></h3><h4><b>Witness doctors</b></h4>The November 15 Watchtower amazingly allows doctors that are Jehovah'sWitnesses to administer blood transfusions to a non - Witness, if this iswhat their job requires. Similarly, Jehovah's Witness butchers and grocersare also allowed to sell foods containing blood (black pudding, etc) to non-Witnesses. That a blood transfusion involves the previous STORING, andprocessing of the blood here seems to be ignored. Yet this storage is thesole reason that Witnesses cannot use their <b>own</b> blood fortransfusions - it has not been &quot;poured out&quot; and therefore would be showingcontempt for Gods word. Witness doctors however, seem to be exempt from thisruling, and may therefore show such contempt for God's Law without penalty.Interestingly, in other matters the organisation will strongly argue thatone must only obey their superiors (boss, government,etc.) when it does notcontravene God's Law, as they see it. The matter of personal conscience doesnot enter in to it. <p>[<i>To illustrate the normal rigidity of stated policies; at the same time(1964) Witnesses in Malawi, Africa were being raped, murdered and torturedbecause of their refusal to purchase a compulsory 35 cent I.D. membershipcard for the Malawi single state national party, which they consideredpolitical affiliation and therefore contrary to their beliefs about keepingseparate from &quot;the world&quot;</i>] </p><p><b></b></p><h4><b>Other restrictions</b></h4>The Awake 8 May 1964 P30, banned the use of cosmetics that used blood intheir manufacturing process. <p>The Watchtower P128 of the same year;</p><p> </p> <ul> <li> prohibited Witness farmers from using fertilisers containing blood products</li> <li> prohibited Witnesses from allowing vets to give transfusions of blood products to their animals or pets prohibited Witnesses from using pet foods that contained blood.</li> </ul><p>Around the late 1960's there was prolific letter writing from Witnessesto food manufacturers to find out whether blood products were being used.

Organ transplants are now cannibalism!</p><p></p> <blockquote> When there is a deceased or defective organ, the usual way health is restored is by taking nutrients. The body uses the food eaten to repair or heal the organ, gradually replacing the cells. When men of science conclude that this normal process will no longer work and they suggest removing the organ and replacing it directly with an organ from another human, this is simply a shortcut. <b>Those who submit to such operations are thus living off the flesh of another human. That is cannibalistic.</b> However, in allowing to eat animal flesh Jehovah God did not grant permission for humans to try to perpetuate their lives by cannibalistically taking into their bodies human flesh, whether chewed or in the form of whole organs or body parts taken from others (WT, 15 November 1967, pp. 702..) </blockquote><p>So although it was OK 6 years ago in 1961 see above, it's nowcannibalism. The organisation had no doubt clarified exactly what JehovahGod gave permission for. The same article was also strong in opposition toany donation of organs that had also previously been a matter of conscience.</p><p><b></b></p><h3><b><a name="1971">1971</a></b></h3><h4><b> The Heart - not just a pump</b></h4><p>The Watchtower 1st March had a lengthy study article stating that(regardless of medical opinion) the heart was more than a pump for ourblood. It was linked with the brain through sensory nerve endings and wasthe actual organ in which <b>affections, motivations, desires andemotions</b> were <b>literally </b> formed. (Page 133-135) Of course theorgan transplant would therefore transfer these emotions, etc to therecipient. Serious &quot;mental aberrations&quot; in heart transplant patients weresaid to be likely caused by the transfusion. (Remember that then [1971]organ transplants were not allowed - they were still cannibalism)</p><p><b></b></p><h3><b><a name="1974">1974</a></b></h3><h4><b>Serums</b></h4>A partial turnabout. Some serums, although derived from blood (see <ahref="#1963"> 1963) are maybe now a matter of conscience again. (Justabout) <p>It can thus be seen that serums (unlike vaccines) contain a blood fraction,though minute... What then of a serum containing only a minute fraction ofblood... We believe that here the conscience of each Christian must decide.Some may feel that accepting such a serum does not constitute an act ofdisrespect... that it does not constitute a flouting of God's expressedwill... the conscience of others may call on them to reject all suchserums... While refraining from approving or condemning in such areas wherewe believe the decision must be left to individual conscience, we do,nevertheless,<b> urge all to seek to maintain their conscience clean beforeGod</b>, never showing deliberate disrespect for his Word. (WT, 1 June 1974,p. 352).</p> <p>Well, the way it reads to me, is that it is being left to conscience, butthe Witness is being led to refuse rather than to accept. Also it appearedthat a serum could only be acceptable if it contained a &quot;minute fraction ofblood&quot; However, the important thing is that a Witness accepting would notnow be disfellowshiped. Bible trained or WBTS trained conscience? </p> <p><b></b></p> <h3><b><a name="1975">1975 </a></b></h3> <h4><b>Haemophiliacs</b></h4>(some information from crisis of conscience - by raymond franz - commentarypress - atlanta) <p>Haemophiliacs within the organisation were in a precarious position. Bloodclotting and coagulant preparations such as Factor VIII (and IX) cansignificantly extend their life. In the 1940s the average life span of ahaemophiliac was less than 17 years. Now days it is almost a normal lifespan. Raymond Franz (an ex Governing Body member) in his book <i>Crisis ofConscience</i> -(Commentary Press, Atlanta 1985) revealed that; the positionof the society was that they had chosen not to publish anything specific onthese particular blood fractions, as they became available. However,haemophiliacs writing to, or telephoning the headquarters of the society wetold that acceptance of the fraction once would be acceptable, but to do somore than once would constitute &quot;feeding&quot; on the blood and would be wrong.The policy was changed, probably sometime in the early 1970's althoughofficially in June 1975. Astonishingly, nothing was actually published till1978 - see below. Administration staff had previously been trying to contacthaemophiliacs by going through the correspondence files. Some were notcontactable because they had telephoned the society with their enquiry. Ithas been reported that the situation caused some resentment amongst theadministration staff. Not surprisingly - It is quite possible that somehaemophiliacs had died simply because they were unaware that the &quot;rules&quot; hadchanged! </p> <p>Interestingly, the 22 Feb. 1975 Awake seems to rule out the treatment ofhaemophiliacs with blood particles or fractions. However (as mentionedabove) there is evidence that those telephoning the headquarters in theearly 1970s were told that a &quot;one off only&quot; treatment was acceptable. AGoverning Body session on June 11th 1975 made the change official andthereafter enquirers were informed that the Factor VIII was an acceptabletreatment (or, at least, up to their conscience). However, it wasn't tilllater in 1978 that it was officially published as not forbidden. Thereforethere were at least 3 years, possibly more, during which a Witnesshaemophiliac would have needed to write or telephone the headquarters of&quot;God's only visible organisation&quot; to find out whether they could maybe savetheir own life with Factor VIII. It wasn't considered important enough topublish.</p> <p>The April 1st Watchtower, page 215-216 also again seems not to rule outWitness doctors from administering a blood transfusion! (see also 1964) Thearticle here specifically deals with cross-matching of blood. Again storageand disrespect for God's laws do not here seem to be an issue. Oneconclusion is that they need all the help they can get in the medical sphereand therefore Witness medics are given an extremely &quot;loose rein&quot; personalitytransplant?</p> <p>Also in 1975 the Watchtower of 1st September again supported the thoughtthat a <b>&quot;personality transplant&quot;</b> could occur through organ transplantsas well as through blood transfusions (Page 519) It gave the example of aperson receiving a kidney transplant could <b>take on the aggression of theblood donor. </b> The article does admit that the problem could be wholly orpartially mental, but finds it of interest because of the Bible's linking ofkidneys and emotions.</p> <p><b></b></p> <h3><b><a name="1977">1977 </a></b></h3> <h4><b>New booklet</b></h4>A new booklet - &quot;Jehovah's Witnesses and the Question of Blood&quot;. Morereversals. Blood transfusions are now considered as organ transplants.(Remember - organ transplants are still <b>not</b> allowed at this time) <p>Consequently, whether having religious objections to blood transfusions ornot, many a person might decline blood simply because it is essentially anorgan transplant that at best is only partially compatible with his ownblood <i>(Jehovah's Witnesses and the Question of Blood, </i>1977, p. 41).</p> <p><b></b></p> <h4><b>Children</b></h4>Where children are affected the booklet argues that the parents must beallowed to refuse blood transfusions for their children. In support of thispage 35 says <p>Are we then to assume that the courts are willing to assign a differentreligion to the children than that of their parents, when statistics showthat the overwhelming majority of children are reared and indeed follow thesame religious denomination?</p> <p>The article fails to mention two things. Firstly, the Witnesses spend muchtime attempting to get other persons to change their religion, and theyclaim great success in this. Secondly, the Witnesses actually have quite ahigh turnover rate (i.e. Over 250,000 left the religion in the U.S.A. alonein the couple of years from 1976 -1978 ) and a significant number of Witnesschildren, on reaching adulthood fall away from the religion. Any Witnessknows this to be true. </p> <p><b></b></p> <h3><b><a name="1978">1978</a></b></h3>A gentler position on serums. Serum injections to fight against disease arenot necessarily wrong. It is &quot;not a clear cut area&quot;. These injections areapparently not a method of &quot;sustaining one's life&quot; in the face of disease. <i>The article quoted below is the one that also (in writing and now finallypublished) allowed haemophiliacs to accept Factor 8 blood fractions morethan once, assuming of course that they hadn't unfortunately haemorrhagedand died already. </i>Part of the article said: <p>What, however, about accepting serum injections to fight against disease...This seems to fall into a &quot;grey area&quot;... we (the organisation) have takenthe position that this question must be resolved by each individual on apersonal basis. We urge each one to have a clear conscience and to be<b>responsive to God's guidance</b> found in his Word (WT, 15 June 1978, pp.30-31).</p> <p>For many sensitive Witnesses, accepting a serum or other &quot;allowed&quot; productturns out to be a recipe for future guilt.

For this reason, each individual faced with making a decision on this matter should carefully and prayerfully weigh matters and then decide conscientiously what he or she could or could not do before God (WT 15 Mar 1980, p31) </blockquote>Do not forget that <b>only three years earlier</b> blood transfusions wererejected because they were essentially organ transplants! <b>See also 1967quotation. 13 years ago it was cannibalism!</b> <p><b> How many Witnesses stayed blind because they could not accept a simplecornea transplant?

(Medical Encyclopaedia, Hamlyns 1981) </blockquote><p>The above is just one of millions of quotations the Jehovah's Witnesswill not normally have his attention drawn to. </p><p><b></b></p><h4><b>Hospital liaison committees</b></h4>By now Jehovah's Witnesses had started setting up hundreds of HospitalLiaison Committees in order to pre-empt the blood issue, especially inemergency cases. This concept was started in Canada in the early 1970s. AllHospitals are systematically approached and have the Witnesses viewpointsexplained. Lists of sympathetic surgeons and doctors are kept. Non-bloodsurgical procedures are also kept on file. <p>The committees will try to circumvent doctors or social services making achild a ward of court if the parent(s) are refusing blood on the child'sbehalf. Usually they will first try to arrange surgery without blood, maybeelsewhere, and almost certainly with increased delay and medical risk. TheLiaison Committees sometimes get involved with legal matters and will oftenfight attempts by doctors and social services to temporarily remove a childfrom its parent's custody in order to administer a transfusion. </p><p><b></b></p><h3><b><a name="1982">1982 </a></b></h3><h4><b>Major and minor components</b></h4>June 22 Awake introduces the concept of what the organisation sees as the<b>MAJOR</b> and <b>MINOR</b> blood components (or fractions) and showstherefore what are and aren't allowed. Minor products are OK, Major ones areforbidden. Summarised as follows<p><b>Blood consists of 54% Plasma, 45% red cells, Platelets 0.17% White cells0.1% The plasma contains all the complex proteins, Albumin, clotting factorsand immune - globulin, fibrinogens etc. </b>To recap:</p><p><b>ALLOWED (subject to personal conscience):</b> Albumin, Immune globulinserums, Factor 8 &amp; 9 for haemophiliacs, blood diversion and treatment ofblood by dialysis machines (as long as they are not primed with blood) etc.</p><p><b>NOT ALLOWED (regardless of conscience: </b> Whole blood, Plasma, Red(erythrocytes) or White (leukocytes) blood cells, Platelets, any storage ofblood - even one's own.</p><p><b></b></p><h4><b>&quot;Small quantities&quot;</b></h4>It should be noted that when asked why the use of ALL blood and products arenot simply banned, the argument is often advanced that preparations etc.involving <b>small quantities</b> of blood puts the matter into &quot;personalconscience&quot;. That is why a Witness will allow a blood test, which wouldinvolve the normally wrong practice of storing the blood, without 'pouringit out'. Why is this? Who decides? What exactly is a &quot;small quantity&quot; - 5ml,10ml, 200ml? How often can one receive this &quot;small quantity&quot;?<p>It is interesting also to take a closer look at the so called &quot;major andminor&quot; components. Many doctors have pointed out that PLASMA (not allowed)is about <b>93% water</b>. The other 7% contains the Albumin, globulin andanti-coagulant agents etc that are <b>ALL ALLOWED</b>. Is it the water thatis ruling it out? I apologise for the cynicism, but I did not make up allthese constantly changing rules and baseless distinctions.</p><p>The white cells or leukocytes (not allowed) are only 0.1% of blood and manymany more leukocytes are actually found in the ORGANS of the body(transplants allowed) and HUMAN MILK. Breast feeding has [thankfully]escaped criticism.</p><p>Albumin, immune globulin and gamma globulin (all allowed) require thedonation of literally litres of blood to manufacture each dose of serum orproduct. Vast blood banks are used to STORE and process all this blood andblood fractions. </p><p>The organisation want to keep their stand on blood but allow the (by nowvery common) use of serums. They graciously leave it to personal conscience.Just how the average Witness is supposed to use his or her conscience indeciding whether to accept or reject any one of a number of a complex bloodderived products is not stated. They are not medics or scientists. Forinstance Pharmacology in Nursing - Bergersen - 1976 Page 525 says (of gammaglobulin / immune globulin)</p><p></p> <blockquote> gamma globulin is derived from an original blood plasma or serum pool that represents at least 1000 individuals. </blockquote><p><b>The blood of a thousand persons! But it's up to your own conscience.No penalty. Accept Plasma though and you will be disfellowshiped!</b></p><p>The amount of blood needed to be donated in order to produce the Factor 8 or9 that a haemophiliac would use in a lifetime would probably amount toliterally hundreds of thousands of pints, all requiring storage (no &quot;pouringout&quot;) at some time. A haemophiliac will generally have to inject themselveswith a large syringe of factor 8 or 9 very regularly, perhaps weekly.</p><p>As earlier mentioned, It would seem logical and acceptable for ones ownblood to be taken and re-used later, if for instance a future operation wasenvisaged. Yet the above mentioned Awake of June 22, 1982 said it was OK tocollect ones own blood as long as it was returned to the body a littlelater. The means of collection &amp; return could not be removed. It is likenedto extending ones circulatory system. This is why kidney dialysis, heartlung machines are acceptable. NO STORAGE of the blood could be allowedthough. <b>The same article in the June 22 1982 Awake on page 25 restatedthat Factor 8 treatment for haemophiliacs was acceptable.</b></p><p><b></b></p><h3><b><a name="1984">1984</a></b></h3><h4><b>Bone marrow </b></h4>Bone-marrow transplant crops up and it seems that it is a matter ofconscience. However, Witnesses are expected to come up with a &quot;no&quot;. A marrowand eating connection is made and this is OK. Yet blood transfusions havealso been regularly likened to eating blood ( the &quot;nourishment&quot; comparison)and were ruled out on that basis<p></p> <blockquote> ... red blood cells are formed in the marrow of certain bones... it is understandable why, in the light of the Bible's prohibition on blood, the question arises whether a Christian could accept a graft of human bone marrow... since red blood cells originate in the red bone marrow, do the Scriptures class marrow with blood? No. In fact, animal marrow is spoken of like any other flesh that could be eaten. Isaiah 25:6. speaks of ... &quot;well oiled dishes filled with marrow&quot;... Of course, marrow used in human marrow transplants is from live donors, and the withdrawn marrow may have some blood in it. Hence, the Christian would have to resolve for himself whether to him the bone marrow graft would amount to simple flesh or unbled tissue... Finally Dr. E. Thomas observes that &quot;virtually all marrow transplant recipients will require platelet transfusions&quot; and may be given &quot;packed red blood cells.... Though a personal decision has to be made on this matter, the Bible 's comments about blood and marrow should help the individual to decide (WT, 15 May 1984, p. 31). </blockquote><p><b>Exactly how?</b> As far as I can see, anyone reading the above wouldprobably be led to refuse rather than accept a bone marrow transplant. Theywould not however be disfellowshiped if they accepted a transplant. In thiscase conscience is introduced so that the organisation do not have tospecifically rule either way. So one is able to eat marrow, which containsblood. One cannot however transfuse or eat blood. Also, why is itsignificant that marrow in human transplants is from &quot;live donors?&quot; Would,therefore, blood from dead humans or animals be acceptable? Of course not.Note how the society stand away from a decision on this argument becauselogic may then lead one to conclude that either</p><p></p> <ul> 1. The Bible is contradictory or 2. The organisation are taking things to extremes in their shifting interpretations of exactly what the Bible writers did and did not mean so long ago. </ul><p>Also, in the 1st September Watchtower the society quietly abandoned thenotion that the actual heart, <b>as an organ,</b> was responsible foraffections, motivations, emotions and desires. (see 1971) Instead the moresensible and common explanation of a &quot;figurative&quot; (as opposed to the&quot;literal&quot;) heart was adopted. </p><p><b></b></p><h3><b><a name="1985">1985 </a></b></h3><h4><b>AIDS</b></h4>(Donated blood is now being routinely heat treated because of the discoveryof AIDS and it's transmission through blood and other body fluids)<p>The organisation again seized upon the AIDS problem to give credibility totheir stand regarding blood and blood products. The 15 June 1985 WatchtowerPage 30 stated that 70 Million units of Factor VIII went from US to Britain,thereby transferring AIDS to the British supply. </p><p>Many persons and organisations are predicting millions of deaths by the mid1990s. </p><p><b></b></p><h3><b><a name="1988">1988</a></b></h3>AIDS has now become a world-wide problem is seized on by organisation innumerous articles as yet further proof of the correctness and theprotectiveness of it's policies.

Please notethis.</b></p><p><b></b></p><h3><b><a name="1989">1989</a></b></h3><h4><b>Use one's own blood?</b></h4>The March 1st Watchtower has an interesting &quot;Question from Readers&quot; The&quot;reader&quot; (yet again) logically asks why Jehovah's Witnesses cannot givetheir own blood that can then be later used in an operation on themselves.This is ruled out as an <b>&quot;unacceptable procedure for Jehovah's Witnesses&quot;</b> Deut 12:24 (from the old Law covenant) is used. There is no &quot;pouringout&quot; of the blood. The analogy with storage is again made. It is thereforesaid to be wrong. The same article states that it is OK to use a dialysismachine or similar. The blood being taken from the body, processed etc andthen returned to the body is seen as an elongation of the circulatory systemand is strangely acceptable. Blood can therefore leave one's body, passthrough a machine that processes it and then returns it to the body. Onecould not similarly treat and return one's own blood sometime later. AWitness will believe that this differentiation is really taught by the Bible itself? <p>I think that the real reason the Governing Body of the organisation cannotaccept this logical treatment is really more concerned with practicalities.If they allowed it (no doubt subject to conscience) there would be many ofthe 4 million or so Witnesses wanting to deposit their blood in case offuture emergency. Blood banks do not have the resources to &quot;tag by name&quot; allthat blood and neither could it be transported to where it was needed if anemergency such as when car accident occurred. The &quot;shelf life&quot; would alsopresent problems.<b>&quot;sustaining life&quot;</b></p><p>The term &quot;sustaining life&quot; has also (by now) virtually replaced the phrase&quot;feeding on blood&quot; or &quot;nutrition&quot; in their publications. It is the&quot;sustaining of life&quot; by means of a transfusion that makes it wrong. Justwhat haemophiliacs, and persons accepting the permitted blood product basedvaccinations and immunisations are doing is not mentioned. Surely that toois a &quot;sustaining of life&quot; ? <b>Why else bother?</b></p><p><b></b></p><h3><b><a name="1990">1990</a></b></h3><h4><b>New brochure</b></h4>1990 saw a new brochure entitled <b>&quot;How can Blood Save Your Life?&quot; </b> Itpresents plenty of evidence of the dangers and risks associated with bloodtransfusions. Many quotations from medical sources are used. As usualthough, the reader is only given one side of the story. As it is theirlatest publication dealing entirely with blood, let's look at some of it<p>Page 8 Quotes the Medical World News - December 11th 1989 to support that ablood transfusion is a <i>&quot;tissue transplant&quot; </i>(italics in the original)It goes on to present a link between cancer and blood transfusions. That maywell be relevant, although no statistics are given. Many things are linkedto Cancer.(including burnt toast)</p><p>Page 13 has an interesting quotation from a Dr Knud Lund-Olesen:</p><p></p> <blockquote> Since some persons in high risk groups volunteer as donors because they then are automatically tested for AIDS, I feel that there is a reason to be reluctant about accepting blood transfusions. Jehovah's Witnesses have refused these for many years. Did they look into the future? (Ugeskrift for laeger Doctors Weekly Sept. 26th <b>1988</b>. </blockquote><p>The inference here is that they were protected or pre-warned by theirbeliefs. </p><p>Page 16 re states that &quot;the conscience of some Witnesses permits them toaccept organ transplants, if done without blood&quot;. Page 18 shows that doctorsneed have no fear of liability as Witnesses will sign release forms. It goeson to speak of &quot;Risk / Benefit Analysis&quot; - making an <i>informed</i> choice,after considering <i>all aspects</i>. I am at a loss as to how a Witness cando this as all they will read is their own organisation's literature, noneof which fairly presents any other viewpoint. Furthermore, a Witnesses&quot;conscience&quot; has only &quot;allowed&quot; them to accept organ transplants<b> sincethe 1980 reversal. </b>That is not really the result of their own conscienceat all. It is following a set of changing rules and regulations.</p><p>[They speak regularly of a &quot;Bible trained conscience&quot; In practice it is a&quot;Watchtower trained conscience&quot;. The first thing a Witness will do whenfaced with a question of the rightness or wrongness of a situation, is tolook it up in their society's literature, regardless of whether the subjectis mentioned in the Bible.]</p><p>The booklet also makes some very strained analogies to say the least. Page20 of the booklet presents a scenario of a doctor forcing a patient to havea tonsillectomy, rather than alternative antibiotic treatment. <b> It goeson to equate forced blood transfusion with forced sex or rape.</b> Page 21,on the very important subject of blood transfusions and children, equatesthe risks of using oil or gas to heat one's home or allowing children to gofor a long car drive with the risk of refusing a blood transfusion on thechild's behalf! The writer wonders why a government or it's courts willpermit parents to allow their children the risk of a car journey, but notthe risk of blood refusal. I can only comment that anyone convinced by suchreasoning in a case of emergency must have totally lost their reasoningpowers. </p><p><b>I do not in any way dispute the parent's love and care for theirchildren,</b> it is just that they seem to have been brainwashed with aconstant stream of one sided arguments. An interesting quotation on page 22from a Doctor James Fletcher:</p><p></p> <blockquote> ..for professional arrogance to supplant sound medical judgement. Treatments regarded as &quot;the best today&quot; are modified or discarded tomorrow&quot; Which is more dangerous, a &quot;religious parent&quot; or an arrogant physician who is convinced his or her treatment is absolutely vital? (Paediatrics - October 1988) </blockquote><p>A sentiment that has some truth. Unfortunately many doctors <b>can be</b> arrogant and unwilling to listen. As for treatments &quot;best today butdiscarded tomorrow&quot; - the same phrase aptly describes the WBTS's rulings onthis subject.</p><p>In answer to the question posed, I 'm afraid that many persons will findthe &quot;religious parent&quot; far more dangerous in this instance.</p><p><b></b></p><h4><b>RH factor</b></h4>The WT June 1st 1990 p30-31 has an article regarding the injection of bloodfractions such as albumin or immune globulin preparations. These are used invery common cases of Rh incompatibility between mother and foetus. (NB If aRh negative mother produces an Rh positive infant then RhIG immune humanglobulin given within 72 hours of birth will protect against blood diseaseproblems in subsequent births) The article says:<p></p> <blockquote> some immune globulin moves from the mother's blood to the foetus. Because of this natural movement of anti-bodies into the foetus occurs in all pregnancies, babies are born with a degree of normal immunity to certain infections ......... because of movement naturally of blood between mother and foetus.. this may be a consideration when a Christian is deciding whether (he?) will accept immune globulin, albumin etc.... each must resolve the matter personally before God. </blockquote><p>Again, <b>how can they practically do this?</b> Just why the whole issueof medicine and blood is not entirely left to personal conscience I do notknow. Neither is the logical conclusion of the above argument mentioned,i.e. that a mother could (subject to conscience) donate blood fortransfusion into her child because of this previous &quot;natural movement&quot; inthe womb. She would find herself quickly disfellowshiped if she did. (oreven if she <i>held the view</i> that she could do so in the future)</p><p></p><p>Earlier on page 8 the same article claimed that haemophiliacs usingplasma based clotting agents to treat their haemophilia have beendevasteted. In the US alone the article states that 60%-90% of them got AIDSprior to the heat treating of blood from donors. It also admits that somecases of AIDS have come through tissue transplants (allowed by theorganisation)</p><p><b>Haemophiliac's Protection</b>??</p><p>By now you may have spotted an anomaly with regard to the question ofAIDS and whether a Jehovah's Witness has been protected from it. One of themost tragic consequences of AIDS, blood and medicine is shown in the case ofhaemophiliacs. They truly have been devasteted as the organisation pointout. The organisation readily grab the praise for it's &quot;protective policies&quot;but fail to mention that the biggest cause of AIDS through blood in thiscase is the Factor 8 <b>WHICH THEY ALLOW!

As earlier mentioned, <b>&quot;sustain life</b>&quot; isthe current preferred phrase. It must be said that for many years medicalscience has realised that blood was used by the body in 3 main ways. </p><p></p> <ul> 1. Transport of essential components (e.g. Oxygen) 2. Maintenance of internal environment, temperature etc. and 3. Defence using immune systems etc. </ul><p> Blood is not used by the body as food. For that to happen, it would needto be eaten and pass through the digestive system. The Awake Oct. 22 page 9seems to go on record with the view that that an intravenous bloodtransfusion is not now a &quot;feeding on blood&quot;. It is instead an &quot;organtransplant&quot;. The organisation had never been able to gain much outsidesupport for the &quot;feeding / nutrition&quot; explanation. By their logic: If blood(when transfused) is being used as a food or nutrition and is also an ORGANtransplant, then logically another organ transplant, say a kidney or heartwould also be used by the body as &quot;food or nutrition&quot;?

The Canadian New Brunswick Court of Appealdeclared him a &quot;mature minor&quot; and upheld his refusal to accept bloodtransfusions. The attitude of Joshua and his family is summed up: <p></p> <blockquote> &quot;..If he recovered he was a winner.. If he didn't, and died and was resurrected to Paradise, he was undoubtedly a winner&quot; and ... &quot;when there was talk of a bone marrow transplant, his brother Jerry was first to offer&quot; </blockquote>[see earlier 1984 for their views on bone marrow ] <p>The article concluded that the case should not have come to court becausethe Act (concerning mature minors in Canada) had been complied with. Joshuadied on October 4th 1994. The same magazine related a case of successfulmajor heart surgery on a Japanese 4 year old called Akane. Such surgery isvery difficult due to the low volume of blood in a 4 year old. Theanaesthesiologist wrote to Akane's mother saying that &quot;his opinion ofdoctors had changed and they should use their firm grasp of medicalknowledge to save lives, but they should also respect the dignity and wishesof the patient&quot; I am puzzled by this because the patient, in that case,<b>was a 4 year old. </b></p> <p>The 15th January Watchtower had an article on page 5 entitled &quot;Treasure theReal Life&quot;. It spoke of blood transfusions &quot;which some doctors call lifesaving&quot; [note the inference] and stated that doctors were realising theimportance of &quot;treating the whole person - physical, spiritual andemotional&quot; The experience of Kumiko was related (pp6-7) She died ofleukaemia, aged 15, refusing to attempt to lengthen her life by &quot;a fewweeks, months or even years&quot; by accepting blood transfusions. Naturally thearticle spoke of this decision enthusiastically. Kumiko's <b>non -Witness</b> father put a note in the funeral casket saying &quot;I will see youin Paradise Kumiko&quot; Most touching but the article failed to clarify theirreal beliefs in this matter - unless her father becomes a Jehovah's Witnesshe will shortly be destroyed at Armageddon and will <b>NOT</b> be seeingKumiko again! </p> <p>The 22 February 1995 related the experience of Mia Bjorndal who had renalfailure. She refused any blood transfusions. During the course of theillness her haemoglobin fell to 1.4 g/dcl (normal 11-16); her serumcreatinine was 682 (55-110 normally); her number of platelets at one stagewas 17,000 per cubic millimetre of blood (150 -450,000 normal) Hertreatment included the extraction of her plasma and the removal of thetroublesome antibodies from this plasma. (by external circulation which, afootnote explained, is left to individual conscience - refers reader toWatchtower 1/3/89.) She again refused transfusions and Mia came perilouslyclose to death - her father saying <b> &quot;Now it's only Mia and Jehovah&quot;</b>(the actual title of the Awake article.) </p> <p>Intravenous injections of immunoglobulins were also tried - 6 grams per dayover 3 days (another footnote said that although immunoglobulin contains &quot;atiny faction of blood&quot; it is again left to conscience - refers reader toWatchtower 1/6/90.) Mia was also treated with erythropoietin (which isbased on albumin from blood plasma - see 1994) Against all odds, sheamazingly recovered. That is not always the case, so I leave the reader todecide the inference suggested by the title of the article. Note also thatshe accepted medication and treatment that some years earlier was <b>not</b>&quot;subject to individual conscience&quot; It was therefore fortunate for Mia thather renal failure had not occurred earlier in her life. </p> <p> All I have done thus far is to collate a resume of the Watchtower beliefs,remove the padding and place them chronologically with a few obviousconclusions. It has probably left you a bit confused? The WTBTS havecertainly got very confused over the years.</p> <p></p> <blockquote> <b>God is not a God of confusion. </b> (1 Cor 14:33 Revised Standard bible) </blockquote> <p>How though does the Headquarters of the Jehovah's Witnesses - theirGoverning Body - arrive at all these rules, regulations and technicaldistinctions from the Bible? After all <b>a Jehovah's Witness will refuse ablood transfusion because he or she believes that is what God requires, andthat God has made that clear in His word - the Bible. </b></p> <p>I cannot accept that all these changing rulings, distinctions andtechnicalities are from God. </p> <p>Neither can I believe that God would require one to sacrifice his or herlife based on them. The arguments are morally and logically flawed.</p> <p></p> <blockquote> <b>Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.... your teachings are but rules made by man. Matt 15:6,9. (New International Bible)</b> </blockquote> <b><h3><a name="section2">Section 2: What does the Bible ActuallySay?</a></h3></b> <p><i>Acknowledgements to David Henke - Watchman Fellowship for some of thefollowing arguments</i></p> <p><b>Surprisingly, very little.</b> The Witnesses organisation base theirpresent beliefs regarding blood on just a couple of main scriptures. One inGenesis 9, the other in Acts 15 and restated in Acts 21. Before we go anyfurther we need to here make a distinction between the Hebrew and Greekscriptures (Old and New Testaments respectively)</p> <p>Much of the Old testament concerns the Laws given by God to the nation ofIsrael, or the Jews. Witnesses, in common with most Christians, believe thatChrist's coming to earth and his sacrifice did away with the need for theold Laws given to the Israelites. Many of these laws compelled Israel tooffer animal sacrifices, perform various rituals and they also forbadeeating blood or unbled meat, animal fat, and certain animals etc.</p> <p>The reason why God placed a restriction on blood in the first place wasbecause as Leviticus 17:11 says, &quot;...for it is the blood that maketh anatonement for the soul.&quot; God was sanctifying, setting apart for a holypurpose, the symbol of life and man's redemption, so that man would have thehighest respect for it. </p> <p>Many pagan religions profaned blood by the way they used it. For instanceit has been the view of many in occultic religions in both ancient andmodern times that if you would eat animal, or even human, flesh while itwas still living you would receive in yourself the strength, or life force,of the thing being eaten. This was the reason why God placed such arestriction on Noah and Israel. </p> <p>In the Old Testament sacrifices we see animal blood being shed for the sinsof the people. These sacrifices typified the shedding of the blood of Jesuson Calvary. So the sanctification of blood as a sacred symbol wasultimately because of the sacredness of the blood of Jesus. However, the purpose of the shedding of blood, whether in type in the Old Testament, orin the reality of Christ in the New Testament, was because the purpose ofGod was to give life. Hence, the value of life itself is preeminent overits symbol, blood. </p> <p>Isn't it interesting that the Church, which God purchased with His ownblood (Acts 20:28) is told to eat Christ's flesh and drink His bloodsymbolically in the Lord's Supper (John 6:53-58). </p> <p>There is a hierarchy of values in the Levitical law. For instance it wasforbidden to the Israelites to gather wood on the Sabbath. When the firstoffender was brought before Moses for judgment Moses was told by God to putthe man to death. Because this was the first offense, and it was a direct challenge to what God had commanded, the severest penalty was required. </p> <p> However, in the New Testament Jesus asked the Pharisees, &quot;Which of youshall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pullhim out on the sabbath day?&quot; (Luke 14:5) The difference in Jesus' exampleis that a life is being saved, even if it is only the life of an animal. Toadminister a blood transfusion to save a life is to endorse, or sustain,the preeminent value, which is life itself. </p> <p>Does self-sacrifice by refusal of a blood transfusion strengthen the valueGod places on life, or weaken it? Is it a sin to sustain life? It would bea sin to throw oneself in front of a Mack truck. But, it would not be a sinif in doing such a thing one was pushing another person out of danger. The difference, life, the life of another, is being valued highly, even thoughit cost a life to do so. With a blood transfusion life is being sustainedbut without the death of anyone else. (D.H.) </p> <p><b>GENESIS 9</b></p> <p>However, <b>before</b> these old laws were given was the great Flood.After the waters had gone, God spoke to Noah and his family saying (usingthe New World Translation - the Witnesses own Bible translation)</p> <p></p> <blockquote> <b>Every moving animal that is alive may serve as food for you. As in the case of green vegetation, I do give it all to you. Only the flesh with it's soul - it's blood - you must not eat. </b> </blockquote>[with it's life, that is it's blood - Revised Standard Bible] <p></p> <blockquote> And besides that, your blood of your souls shall I ask back. From the hand of every living creature shall I ask it back; and from the hand of man, from the hand of each one who is his brother, shall I ask back the soul of man. Anyone shedding man's blood, by man will his own blood be shed, for in God's image he made man. And as for you men, be fruitful and become many, make the earth swarm with you and become many in it. (Genesis 9:3 -7 NWT) </blockquote> <p>The Witnesses will argue that this command, about blood, given to Noahand his family, applies to all mankind, from then down to today. This issaid to be because we all descended from Noah. Whether that extension isvalid, we just do not know for sure - the Bible simply does not specificallysay. Some agree, others do not. Many scholars consider that it simply meantthat God was now allowing man to eat meat (previously the diet has beenvegetarian) but the animal had to be dead, i.e. without life,<i>represented</i> by the blood. After reading these verses in a number oftranslations, I tend to agree with the Witnesses on the point that that<i>unbled </i>animals are probably being referred to. It's extension to allmankind is less clear. </p> <p><b>Genesis 9:4</b> is the first prohibition against the eating of blood. Godgave Noah and his family permission to use animal flesh as food but Herestricted that permission by saying,</p> <blockquote> &quot;But the flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.&quot; </blockquote> <p>Because this was given to Noah and his family, which then constitutedthe entire human race, and was prior to the Law, the Watchtower says thisrestriction was a universal one <b>(JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES AND THE QUESTION OFBLOOD,p.7). </b></p> <p>Two other things should be pointed out here. First, there are two kinds of'flesh' discussed. The first is living animals, or 'flesh with the lifethereof,' (KEIL &amp; DELITZSCH COMMENTARY ON THE OLD TESTAMENT), and thesecond is unbled dead meat. This restriction is given to show respect forthe blood of sacrifices. </p> <p> Second, the claim by Jehovah's Witnesses that this prohibition is universalon all mankind is not warranted because Noah and his family were the onlybelievers who were saved through the Flood so the prohibition could stillbe limited to believers only. And, Moses was inspired by God to say, &quot;Yeshall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself: thou shalt give it untothe stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sellit unto an alien: for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God.&quot;(Deut.14:21) </p> <p>Further, the Watchtower is inconsistent by saying Genesis 9:4 is universalbut in the Watchtower of November 15, 1964, pages 682,683 they say it wouldbe permissible for a Jehovah's Witness doctor to administer blood to a non-Witness patient because Deuteronomy 14:21 allows the Israelites to sellunbled meat to the Gentiles. (David Henke) </p> <p>If we accept that God' words to Noah apply to all mankind right down totoday, then what about the rest of Genesis 9, see above, especially the partabout &quot;being fruitful and making the earth swarm with you&quot;? In 1941 the WBTSissued a book about and called &quot;Children&quot;. It clearly discouraged Witnessesfrom marrying and having children. (See pages 366-7 for instance) In manyother publications and articles since, the Witnesses are often encouraged toconsider the preaching work as more important than marriage or havingchildren. </p> <p></p> <blockquote> Today, childbearing is not specifically a part of the work Jehovah has committed to his people.... each couple must decide for itself. Watchtower March 1st 1988 </blockquote> <p><b>They seem to be picking and choosing the parts they want to from&quot;these universal laws for all mankind&quot;, given to Noah.</b></p> <p>The words to Noah, after forbidding the eating of blood, later went on toforbid murder. (see Gen 9 quote above) In a typical piece of WBTS reasoning,the booklet Jehovah's Witnesses and the Question of Blood on page 8 states</p> <p></p> <blockquote> Later in the Law given to Israel, Jehovah God prohibited murder, <b>bearing out that mandate given to Noah was still in effect</b>. (Ex 20:13) </blockquote> <p><b>It does no such thing!</b> There are two clearly different andseparate subjects - eating blood and murder. By that reasoning you could saythat that years later when Jesus also forbade murder he was endorsingeverything else that was also in the old Law covenant to Israel. This typeof reasoning, although plainly ridiculous, is quite common.</p> <p>Anyway, the command to Noah is one forbidding the eating of either unbled orpossibly still living animals, depending upon how you read it. </p> <p><b></b></p> <h4><b><b>THE OLD LAW</b></b></h4>Later came the Law to Israel. As mentioned, the Witnesses agree that it wassuperseded by means of Christ's ransom sacrifice (Rom 10:4, 6:14 Col2:13-14) but they will sometimes quote it when it suits them. <p>Incidentally, that old law for the Israelites makes a number of otherstatements about blood and related subjects:</p> <p></p> <blockquote> ..eat no meat with blood in it. Blood is the life and you mustn't eat the life with the meat (Lev 17:10,11, 13, 14 see also Deut 12:23-25) </blockquote> <p>Note that verses 13, 14 are the scriptures speaking of the<b> &quot;pouringout&quot;,</b> the relevance of which the organisation have arbitrarilytransferred to modern times (with exemptions in cases of Jehovah's Witnessdoctors, blood tests , serums and other WBTS designated &quot;minor&quot; bloodproducts etc.)</p> <p>The old Law also forbade eating fat (Lev 7:25, 11:2-8) and animals that diednaturally (Lev 11:39) Certain animals were also forbidden to be eaten, aswas shellfish. The Law had many many rules and instructions for Israel. Ifone takes time to read through the old Law covenant, mainly in Leviticus andDeuteronomy it becomes clear that most references to blood show that standsfor the lost life. When sacrificing an animal to God, they had to pour outthe blood because it <b>represented</b> the animals <b>former </b> life, <b>now expired</b>. That is why they were forbidden to eat it. A blood donorhowever does not die. </p> <p>However, as we have said, Christ did away with the old covenant and the needfor lots of complicated laws. It seems that the WBTS are intent on replacingthem.</p> <p><b> Leviticus 17:10&quot; </b></p> <p></p> <blockquote> &quot;And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.&quot; </blockquote> <p> Since this text is part of the Law it cannot be said to be applicableto all of mankind. It is speaking directly to the offense of drinkingblood. Because blood is at the heart of the Old Testament sacrificialsystem, and typified the blood of Christ, it carried a heavier penalty thaneating unbled meat. If you will read verse 15 you will see the very mildpenalty for eating unbled meat. The reason for the difference is that whenan animal is killed by an Israelite he is to show his reverence for lifeand the atonement by pouring out the blood. However, the Law, and the type,are fulfilled in Christ. As Matthew Henry says in his COMMENTARY, &quot;Thisreason is now superseded, which intimates that the law itself wasceremonial, and is now no longer in force...&quot; (p.131). </p> <p>The strictest orthodox Jews who still practice the Old Testament dietarylaws have never equated a blood transfusion with eating blood. In factamong all the sects who claim to follow Christ the Jehovah's Witnessesstand alone on this issue. No one else sees any connection between eatingblood and transfusing it. </p> <p></p> <h4><b>ACTS 15</b></h4>So far then we have the command given to Noah in Genesis. The <b>second</b>scriptural passage used by Witnesses focuses on Acts 15: 19-21. The contextconcerns an argument that arose in 49 CE as a result of some teaching thatnon Jews (Gentiles) that accepted Christianity should be circumcised (likethe Jews) so as not to cause friction or offence. The Apostles and older menin Jerusalem discussed the matter and James (in the crucial scripture) saidthat they: <p></p> <blockquote> ..should <b>abstain </b>from things polluted by idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from blood . </blockquote> <p>The organisation will argue that to abstain from blood would mean to shunblood<b> in any form</b>, whether it is by eating or transfusion. As we haveseen, they have on many occasions attempted to connect the two by likeningtransfusions to a &quot;feeding or nutrition&quot;. The Greek word translated as&quot;abstain&quot; simply means to &quot;stand away from&quot;. Some other translations suchas GNB simply translate the blood part as &quot;eat no blood&quot;, realising thatcontextually the scripture is talking about the eating of blood, keeping thepeace with the Jews who had been forbidden to eat blood by the old law. Inthe 1st Century <b>THERE WAS NO OTHER USE FOR BLOOD,</b> and theorganisation are making far too much of the word &quot;abstain&quot;. In 1 Peter 2:11the same Greek word is used - &quot;keep abstaining from fleshly desires &quot;.Obviously this doesn't mean shunning all forms of all fleshly desires ,including sleeping breathing and eating! In any case, if they want to treatthe word in such an all embracing manner, they would abstain from bloodtests, blood based serums, vaccines end everything else. It would also bemost important to make 100% sure that any food was free from blood,especially added blood produce in manufacture. (see 1992) </p> <p>Remember the words of Charles Taze Russell, the founder of the religion .They have been echoed by many Bible commentators since. On Acts 15:</p> <p></p> <blockquote> The things here recommended were necessary to a preservation of the fellowship of the &quot;body&quot; composed of Jews and Gentiles... A similar thought attaches to the prohibition of the use of blood. To the Jew it was forbidden... These prohibitions had never come to the Gentiles, because they had never been under the Law Covenant; but so deeply rooted were the Jewish ideas on the subject that it was necessary for the peace of the church [or congregation] that the Gentiles should observe this matter also (Zion's Watchtower ,15 April 1909, p. 4374). </blockquote> <p>In the booklet &quot;Jehovah's Witnesses and the Question of Blood - 1977 page17, the command to Noah after the flood is discussed, followed by James'words in Acts 15. They then conclude that it was not a temporary measurebecause it was re stated in Acts 21:25, which they believe to be 10 yearslater. But Acts 21 simply says the same thing as Acts 15 and the textclearly concerns the very same (Jews / Gentiles) issue .</p> <p>After a discussion of Genesis 9 and Acts 15, the booklet then boldly stateson page 17:</p> <p> &quot;up to this point we have established the following: <b>A human is not to sustain his life with the blood of another creature&quot;. (page 17) </b></p> <p><b>They haven't! </b> All they have actually established is that </p> <p>1. God told Noah not to eat unbled (or possibly living) animals, and2. The Gentiles, so as not to stumble Jews back in the 1st Century were admonished to abstain from certain things in the Jewish Law, including blood. This obviously referred to the eating of blood or unbled animals.</p> <p><b>And that is all they have ever established, because the Bible has no moreto say on the matter</b></p> <p>The phrase <b>&quot;not to sustain one's life with blood&quot;</b> has been entirelyintroduced by the WBTS and is a <b>&quot;red herring&quot; having no biblicalsupport.</b> In any case, eating meat <b>with</b> or without blood in itwould <b>both sustain life.</b> The &quot;sustaining of life&quot; is not mentionedand is not a factor in emergencies</p> <p>In the same booklet, the question is asked on page 9 ..<b> &quot;Could God's lawon blood be set aside in times of emergency&quot;</b>? (the inference beingemergency blood transfusion - the word &quot;emergency&quot; fitting in nicely here)Of course it comes up with the answer &quot;No&quot;, and refers the reader to 1Samuel 14:31-35 where some soldiers of Israel were hungry after a longbattle and slaughtered some sheep and fell about eating them without seeingthat they were fully bled. <b>The booklet fails to point out that &quot;God's lawon blood&quot; here referred to is the OLD law to the Israelites that itacknowledges was superseded by Christ. Secondly, it fails to explain how&quot;hunger after a battle&quot; constitutes an &quot;emergency&quot;. in the sense it wants toportray. I consider that a child in an operating theatre with severe bloodloss and a blood count of just 7, and it's life ebbing away is an&quot;emergency&quot;. A group of hungry soldiers is not!</b> I find the WBTS'sargument and inference most disturbing.</p> <p>A couple more scriptures (not mentioned by Witnesses when discussing blood)are well worth considering. They are both in the New Testament, andtherefore applicable to Christians. They show that the numerous foodrestrictions of the old law are no longer required.</p> <p></p> <blockquote> <b>Listen to me, all of you, and understand - there is nothing outside the man which going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are what defile the man... Mark 7:14-19</b> </blockquote> <p>But food will not commend us to God; we are neither the worse if we donot eat, nor the better if we do eat - 1 Cor 8:8</p> <p>I hope that I have thus far at least demonstrated that many of the argumentsput forth by the WBTS do not stand up to close scrutiny. They make rulesthat must be followed, change them without pointing out the change and thenwhen they get into a bit of a quandary they stand away and try to leave itto conscience. They show an almost breathtaking arrogance. If the matter wasnot so serious it would be almost comical. </p> <p></p> <blockquote> <b>[They] attempted to tie us up with rules and regulations. Galations 2:4 (Phillips Modern English)</b> </blockquote> <blockquote> Dearly loved friends, don't always believe everything you hear just because someone says it is a message from God: test it first to see if it really is. (1 John 4:1 -The Living Bible) </blockquote> <p></p> <hr /> <b><h3><a name="experiences">Section 3: Experiences</a></h3></b>Witness publications regularly back up their non blood beliefs withexperiences &quot;proving&quot; that even medically, their way is the best way Anaverage Witness will probably think that if all transfusions ceasedtomorrow, survival rates would actually improve! <p>For example the Awake March 8th 1991 p 13 has Sonya's and Jonathan'sexperiences : </p> <blockquote> Sonya, a bright 13 year old learned in 1989 that she had a cancerous tumour in one eye. The tumour was growing rapidly and surgery was required. The hospital said that it was a serious condition and that a blood transfusion may be required during the operation. The article states that &quot;the family could not consent to that because of their religious convictions&quot;... &quot;The <b><i>competent</i></b> surgeon caring for Sonya was willing to remove the cancerous tumour, confident that she could do so without a blood transfusion. However because of hospital policy, the surgeon could not get an anaesthesiologist to assist&quot;. The Witnesses hospital liaison committee are able to help and made arrangements for her to be transferred to a medical centre in another country. The surgeon agreed to be part of the team in the other country. The article reports that &quot; after the eight and a half hour operation, Sonya's first words were an anxious inquiry as to whether blood has been forced on her. What a joy for Sonya to know that the answer was no!&quot; </blockquote> <p>The article did not feel the need to tell us the result of the operationor even how Sonya was at that time, 2 years later in 1991. I guess that theyhad made the only point they wanted to. Note also the inference of the word<b>&quot;competent&quot;</b> that leads the reader to conclude that other surgeonsunwilling to operate are incompetent? (italics mine). This type of assertionis frequently used by the WBTS. The other example on the same page relatesthe case of Jonathan. It says, </p> <p></p> <blockquote> &quot;Jonathan is the oldest son of Michael and Valerie. In late 1989 when he was 16 doctors informed them that Jonathan had a very large growth on his spleen. Doctors were somewhat apprehensive about operating without using blood, but they <b><i>courageously</i></b> [note the inference again] did so, respecting the family's religious stand. During the recovery period, serious complications developed. Jonathon's blood pressure dropped dramatically, and his blood count fell. In a second operation, he lost a great deal of blood , his haemoglobin falling to 5.5, which is about a third of normal level. The internist exclaimed: &quot;your son's condition is plummeting. We are up against a wall. If he doesn't receive blood he may die!&quot; What to do? ... In Jonathan's case, when his blood count fell to 5.5 after two operations, the doctors were convinced that a blood transfusion was necessary to save his life, and they were ready to seek a court order to force blood on him. But Jonathon's firm faith and personal resistance to the use of blood slowed things down. Jonathan reports: &quot; I took Dr.______ by the collar and looked him in the eye and said, 'No blood or blood products, PLEASE!&quot;' The committee of trained brothers helped arrange for Jonathan to be airlifted to a larger medical facility... The next day Jonathon's haemoglobin stabilised. His blood count steadily improved, and he was released 15 days after the initial operation. </blockquote> <p>That is just two from the many hundreds of similar experiences an averageWitness will hear over the years. I strongly believe that it is morallywrong to continually report favourable experiences, when things turn out OK.They lead their readers to think that refusal of blood is a valid decisionon medical grounds alone. In reality, many thousands and thousands of bloodtransfusions take place every day. Statistically, any problems are verysmall in number, and are not a major medical concern, despite all theWitnesses organisation's publicity of any adverse minority viewpoints. Onthe other hand, hundreds of Witnesses die annually after refusing blood. Ofcourse we cannot say for sure that it would or could have saved or extendedtheir lives, but statistically the evidence is that in many cases it wouldhave. When they do report cases of Witnesses dying after refusal to accepttransfusions , the text will always dwell on things such as; </p> <p></p> <ul> 1. the faithfulness of the Witness, especially if it is a child, 2. positive statements about their faith from medical personnel3. the resurrection hope and statements about the resurrection made by the former patient (NB The present teaching about the resurrection has also been subject to much change in the Witnesses short 120 year history) </ul> <p>The doubts, worry, panic, tears and trauma of the situation are notreported sufficiently or in an unbiased manner in such articles.</p> <p>All Witnesses read and believe fully and without question all of theirsociety's current publications. <b>They must.</b> They are not able toseriously question anything. They are being given a one sided view on whichto base a decision that could maybe cost them their life. </p> <p><b></b></p> <h4><b>An alternative experience</b></h4>Discover magazine August 1988 pages 28-30 had an article by Dr. ElisabethRosenthal titled &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot;. It concerns a Ms Peyton, a 42 yearold Witness who had had several tumours removed from her bladder over thecourse of a number of years. She was bleeding heavily and needed anoperation. She refused a blood transfusion and the doctors and surgeons weredoing their best <b>: As reported in &quot;In Search of Christian Freedom&quot; RayFranz ,- 1992 Commentary Press Atlanta.</b> <p></p> <blockquote> As her blood count dropped further, Ms Peyton became short of breath. The body's organs need a certain amount of oxygen (O2) to function. The oxygen is carried from the lungs to the periphery by haemoglobin molecules in the red cells. By now she was breathing supplemental oxygen - pure oxygen. The few red cells she had were fully loaded -but there weren't enough vehicles left to transport the fuel her body needed. <p> Her hunger for air increased. Her respiratory rate climbed. She became more and more groggy, and finally - inevitably - the muscle fibres of her heart declared there desperate need for oxygen. She developed crushing, severe chest pain. As I walked into the room I was awed by the scene in front of me. At the centre of everyone's attention was a large woman with an oxygen mask, gasping for air, breathing faster than seemed humanly possible. At the head of the bed were three friends, fellow church members, coaching her.. At her side were several doctors -one monitoring her falling blood pressure, another coaxing some blood from an artery. The fluid that slowly filled the syringe had the consistency of Hawaiian punch: tests on the same revealed a red cell count of 9 (normal would have been 40). Hanging from the bed was a bag of cherry-red urine. The woman was dying. Her cardiogram tracings showed the deep valleys that signal a heart in pain. Within a matter of hours the damage they represented would become irreversible.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> The woman went into cardiac arrest. CPR (Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation) was started. The team of doctors and nurses administered epinephrine and atropine (heart stimulants) Defibrillation - electric shock - was performed. The heart fluttered into activity then stopped. More CPR, more epinephrine and atropine, more defibrillation, more CPR. This went on for an hour, until there was no longer any hope or purpose. <b>Ms Peyton was dead beyond recovery.</b> </blockquote> <p>Note the blood count was 9. Most Witnesses will think that bloodtransfusions are unnecessary for the treatment of blood counts even as lowas 5. In many of the experiences related to them, it stabilises, and thepatient recovers!</p> <p>Another case concerns Yvonne Leighton from Tyne &amp; Wear and was reportedin the Daily Telegraph in 1993. Yvonne was just 28 and had given birth toher second child. During a simple operation a few days after the birth,Yvonne haemorrhaged. Her blood count dropped. <b>Blood substitutes weregiven but they did not help. </b> The doctors spent hours trying to getYvonne to have a transfusion to no avail. The Witnesses warned the doctorsthat if they gave blood against Yvonne' wishes, then a charge of criminalassault would be brought. Sadly, Yvonne simply bled to death. </p> <p>According to the WBTS, she died, rejecting the &quot;symbol of life&quot; - blood. Yetshe lost her life, and was willing to do so. </p> <p><b></b></p> <h4><b><b>She had been led to believe that the &quot;symbol &quot; was more importantthan the thing it symbolised .</b></b></h4>There are many many more similar cases. Further examples serve no purpose. Ihave simply related two typical Witnesses approved &quot;experiences&quot; followed bytwo others. <p><b></b></p> <h3><b>Conclusions</b></h3> <br />Well, what conclusions do <b>you</b> draw. Whether you are an elder,patient or friend you should consider : <p></p> <ul> Is the WBTS organisation qualified to make and change rules on which life ordeath may be in question? Are they consistent? What does the evidence show? </ul> <ul> If proof of discrepancies and inconsistencies are put to the organisation,then the usual explanation is that God is gradually making things brighter -like a light getting brighter and brighter. Proverbs 4:18 is often quoted.(somewhat mis-applied and out of context) This does not explain why certaindoctrines change (get brighter?) only to revert to the former belief a fewyears later. Is this the way a God of Love would deal with his peoplethrough His sole visible organisation or channel? God wants them to bemisled or to follow wrong and false ideas ? - so he allows His only earthlyorganisation to advance such ideas? He wants anyone questioning thatorganisation to be severely cut off, and worthy of death? <b>That does notsound like the God of the Bible to me.</b> </ul> <ul> <b>What will you do?</b> <br /> <b>Do you Care?</b> <br /> <b>What now? </b> <br /> <b>Will you just hope it doesn't ever affect you?</b> <br /> <b>Or your Children </b> <br /> <b>Or your loved ones?</b> <br /> </ul> <p>If it does I sincerely hope that God, and not an organisation of men,helps you to the correct decision. </p> <p>You cannot now simply echo the Witnesses usual sentiment and say that &quot;Iwill follow the organisation&quot; or &quot;if anything is wrong, it will be put rightlater&quot; Such a statement is similar to the statements made by the guards inthe concentration camps. They were &quot;just following orders&quot; That explanationis often quoted and decried by the WBTS organisation. So, if you are aWitness, what should you do? The Awake magazine, in an article aimed atLutherians, put it well:</p> <p></p> <blockquote> If after making an honest investigation, you are less than pleased with what you see, do more than just complain. A journalist, commenting on Karl Barth's statement that a church IS it's members, logically concluded: &quot;Church members are responsible for what the church says and does&quot;. So ask yourself: Am I willing to share responsibility for <b>everything</b> my church says and does? You may sincerely believe that your church is no part of false religion that God says he will soon destroy. But your life depends on being 100 % sure. Are you? (Awake - September 8th, 1987) </blockquote> <p>Why, in response to any sincere questioning of their beliefs orinterpretations, does the WBTS resort to <b>attacking the source of thequestioning - rather than simply using the Bible and refuting theevidence.</b> </p> <p>Question the motives of a questioner <b>by all means </b>- but don't<b>ALSO</b> ignore the questions! Surely a simple disproving of theallegations or claims, using the Bible would be more effective. Why can'tWitnesses hold their beliefs up to even a simple examination, as required inthe Bible itself, <b>and as indeed they require of others? </b></p> <p>As far as the History of the Witnesses and blood goes, it's quite obviouswhy they can't, or won't. </p> <p>Jerry Bergman in his book &quot;Jehovah's Witnesses and the Problems of MentalHealth&quot; relates a conversation with a former Witness previously on the&quot;Awake&quot; writing staff. This person admitted to Dr Bergman that the beliefsand interpretations regarding blood, the Bible and transfusions wereconsidered to be in error by some senior headquarters staff. They arehowever, unable (or unwilling) to change policy because it is so firmlyestablished and a change would cause an embarrassing loss of face. So manyhave lost so much through faithful adherence to the policy in the past.- itcannot now be seen to have been in vain. </p> <p>The history of the shifting policies and distinctions made by the WBTS seemto be the confused reactions of a group of men. Sincere - undoubtedly, butalso, in my opinion, tragically misguided. </p> <p><b>I could not therefore let a child of mine die because of their &quot;presentbeliefs&quot;., which are actually just &quot;organisational rules&quot;. </b></p> <p><b>Michael Fry</b></p> <p></p> <blockquote> <b>We are not dictators over your faith, but are fellow workers with you for your happiness. (2 Corinthians 1:24 Jerusalem Bible)</b> <p>&lt; B&gt;Test everything. Hold on to the good. <b>1 Thess 5:21 (New International Version)</b></p> </blockquote> <p><b></b></p> <h3><b><a name="appendix">APPENDIX</a></b></h3> <br /> <b>The March 1991 Kingdom Ministry (a monthly ministry sheet for baptisedWitnesses only) contained an insert entitled: </b> <p></p> <h4><b>Are You Ready to Face a Faith Challenging Medical Situation? </b></h4>The full text follows. <p><i>No one thinks much about the possibility of being in a hospital today ortomorrow. Still, &quot;time and unforeseen occurrence befall us all&quot;. (EccI.9:11) Even if you do not accept medical treatment as your preferred form ofhealth care, what will you do to protect yourself from an unwanted bloodtransfusion should an accident leave you unconscious and you are rushed to ahospital? Yes, an accident or a suddenly deteriorating health situation canabruptly bring you face-to-face with a challenge to your faith.</i></p> <p><i>2 If you should find yourself in a hospital for any reason, what will you doto maintain integrity if some- one there tells you that you will die withouta blood transfusion? Will you hastily accept that this claim trulyrepresents your condition? Are you fully convinced that you do not wantblood? Are you ready to face this challenge to your faith and &quot;abstain fromblood&quot;? -Acts 15:28, 29.</i></p> <p><i>Successfully resisting an unwanted, spiritually contaminating bloodtransfusion starts with a firm conviction. Such a conviction must be basedon a clear understanding of what the Bible says about blood. Otherwise, youcan, in the emotion of the moment, easily be intimidated by someone whoclaims to know more about the situation than you do. Would you be misledinto thinking that maybe doctors know more about blood than God does?Surely, in these circumstances you will want to be &quot;firmly resolved&quot; to do&quot;what is right&quot; in Jehovah&quot;s eyes, no matter what mere humans may say.(Deut. 12:23-25) But do you have to face this challenge all by yourself?-Eccl. 4:9-12.</i></p> <p><i><b>HOSPITAL INFORMATION SERVICES AND HOSPITAL LIAISON COMMITTEES</b></i></p> <p><i>To assist those who need help when faced with a blood transfusion problem,the Society has set up Hospital information Services at Brooklyn. It hasalso established 100 Hospital Liaison Committees in ma- major U.S. cities.These committees are made up of more than 600 elders specially trained forthis work. In Britain the Society maintains a Hospital Information Desk atBethel, and twenty Hospital Liaison Committees have recently been appointedin major cities and more are to follow. Hospital Information Services isable to do research in more than 3,600 medical journals world-wide to locateinformation on the availability and effectiveness of many forms of bloodlesssurgery and treatment. It then supplies Hospital Liaison Committees, healthcare centres, and some doctors with information on these medical advances.(Sometimes Hospital Information Services has sent out medical articles thatshow what can be done without blood and successfully defused an ongoingconfrontation at a hospital.) It keeps the committees posted on favourablecourt decisions that will assist judges in looking at our cases with addedinsight.</i></p> <p><i>It also maintains records on over 7,000 co-operative physicians so that thecommittees have up- to- date files to use when blood transfusion problemsarise.</i></p> <p><i>Hospital Information Services also supervises the training and work of theHospital Liaison Committees. In the cities where they are located, HospitalLiaison Committees regularly make informative presentations to hospitalstaff to improve relations with them. They also poll these medical personnelto find any additional doctors who will treat us without using blood. Thesebrothers stand ready to help you but there are crucial advance steps youmust take to lay the groundwork for them to do that most effectively.</i></p> <p><i><b>CRUCIAL ADVANCE STEPS -HAVE YOU TAKEN THEM YET?</b></i></p> <p><i>First, make sure all in the family have their personal medical directivedocument thoroughly filled in-dated, signed, and Witnessed. Please note thatrevised cards came into use in January 1991. Some brothers arriving at ahospital with an undated and/or unwitnessed document have had its validitychallenged. And do all our unbaptized children have their filled-inidentification cards? If not, in an emergency involving your child, how dohospital personnel know your position on blood and whom to call?</i></p> <p><i>Then see to it that all keep these documents with them AT ALL TIMES. Checkthis with your children before they go to school each day, yes, even beforethey go to a playground or recreational area. All of us should be sure thatthese documents are with us at work, when on vacation, or at a Christianconvention. Never be without them!</i></p> <p><i>Think what could happen to you if you should arrive in a serious conditionat the emergency room of a hospital, unconscious and/or unable to speak foryourself. If you do not have the document with you, and there is no relativeor elder yet at the hospital to speak for you, and it is concluded that you&quot;need blood,&quot; you &quot;I will likely receive a blood transfusion. Unfortunately,this has happened to some. But when we have the document, it speaks for us,expressing our will.</i></p> <p><i>That is why a medical document is better than a medical bracelet ornecklace. The latter do not explain our Bible-based reasons for our positionand do not have signatures verifying what is stated. A Canadian court (decision said about a sister's document: &quot;The patient has chosen in the onlyway possible to notify doctors and other providers of healthcare, should shebecome unconscious or otherwise unable to convey her wishes, that she doesnot consent to blood transfusions&quot;. So never be without it!</i></p> <p><i>Since our medical directive is designed mainly for dealing with emergencysituations, then in elective surgery you would be wise to write out your ownpersonalized, more complete advance directive (based on our medicaldirective) so that you can include specifics, such as the type of surgeryand the hospital. It is your right to do this and thus ensure the treatmentof your choice. Even though you and the doctor may not anticipate seriousproblems, explain that this directive is to be followed in case of anyunexpected developments.-Prov. 22:3.</i></p> <p><i>The next important step is to talk to the necessary medical personnel thatyou will have to deal with in either elective or emergency treatment. Towhom especially should you speak?</i></p> <p><i><b>TALK TO MEDICAL PERSONNEL</b></i></p> <p><i>THE MEDICAL TEAM: This is a time when the fear of man must not prevail.(Prov. 29:25) If you appear unsure, someone may decide you are not sincere.When surgery is needed, elective or emergency, you or the nearest familymember must with determination ask some pointed questions of the head of thesurgical team.</i></p> <p><i>One important question is, Will the team respect the patient's wishes and inall circumstances treat without blood? Without this assurance you would notbe well protected.</i></p> <p><i>State plainly and with dignified conviction what your wishes are. Make itclear that you want alternative non-blood medical management of yourproblem. Calmly and confidently discuss both your own advance medicaldirective and also the hospital's release from liability form. If thesurgeon is unwilling to work with your wishes, you will save time if you askthe consultant or your own general practitioner to locate another doctor foryou. That is part of his job.</i></p> <p><i><b>ANAESTHETIST:</b> Of all on the medical team that you need to talk tobefore surgery, YOU MUST NOT FAIL TO SPEAK TO THIS DOCTOR. Charged withkeeping you alive while the surgeon operates, the anaesthetist is the onewho makes decisions about such matters as the use of blood. So you are notfully protected by just talking to the surgeon. Hence, you must speak withand convince the anaesthetist as to your position, determining whether itwill be respected or not.-Compare Luke 18:3-5.</i></p> <p><i> The usual practice, it seems, is for the anaesthetist to visit the patientbriefly rather late on the night before surgery-too late if he is opposed toyour stand on blood. Insist that the surgeon preselect a co-operativeanaesthetist that you can talk to well in advance of elective surgery. Thenthere will be time to locate another one if the first one is unwilling toabide by your wishes. Do not let anyone try to talk you out of this right tobe satisfied with the anaesthetist for your surgery.</i></p> <p><i> </i></p> <p><i>To all of these, you must make clear your non-negotiable stand: NO BLOOD.Ask for alternative non- blood medical management of your case. Mention anyknown alternatives to blood for your situation. If the medical team feelsthese are not useful in your case, ask them to research other possibilitiesin the medical literature. Assure them you can get them some information ifthey wish by your asking your elders to contact the nearest Hospital LiaisonCommittee.</i></p> <p><i><b>EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS</b></i></p> <p><i>Examine carefully the consent form the hospital asks you to sign uponadmittance. Sometimes right after stating that they will respect your wishesa succeeding paragraph will declare that the signer agrees that the hospitalcan administer &quot;lifesaving treatment when they encounter problems. Thatcould include blood. </i></p> <p><i>You have the right to alter any such statements to exclude blood or crossthem out altogether. Nurses may try to tell you that you cannot do that, butyou can! Explain that such a form is a contract with them and that youcannot sign a contract you do not agree with. If anyone tries to force youto sign against your will, ask to speak to the consultant and/or the patientrepresentative for that health care centre.</i></p> <p><i>Can you do such things? Yes, you can. So be aware of your rights as apatient. These human rights are not left at the front door when you enter ahospital. You do not have to give them up in order to get treatment. Do notlet anyone tell you otherwise.</i></p> <p><i>One such right is called the right of bodily integrity, which means that notreatment of any kind can be given you without your permission. You can evenrefuse all treatment if you wish. Your consent to treatment should follow aclear explanation of what the medical team intends to do, including allrisks. Next, they should tell you about any alternatives that are available.Then, after you have been informed, you choose what treatment you wish.</i></p> <p><i>To be sure of what you are consenting to, you MUST ask good questions aboutanything you do not understand, especially when large words or medical termsare used by the hospital personnel. For example, if a doctor says he wouldlike to use plasma,' you could innocently conclude he is referring to a&quot;plasma volume expander,&quot; but not so. Before agreeing, ask: &quot;Is that acomponent of blood?&quot; About any of his procedures, ask: Does that treatmentinvolve the use of blood products?&quot; If he describes some device he wouldlike to employ, ask: &quot;Is my blood stored at any time during the use of thisdevice?&quot;</i></p> <p><i>But what should you do if you have done all the above and there is still noco-operation or even some resistance to your position? Do not hesitate toask for help. Some have waited too long to get help and put their very livesin danger.</i></p> <p><i><b>VALUABLE HELP IN A TIME OF NEED</b></i></p> <p><i>Note the following procedure for obtaining needed help: (1) As soon as youor a loved one faces either elective or emergency surgery where there is aconfrontation because the hospital wants to use blood; or (2) if yourmedical situation or that of a loved one deteriorates seriously; or (3) ifin the case of a child (or an adult), the doctor, a nurse, an administrator,or a social worker says they are going to get a court order, then:</i></p> <p><i><b>CALL YOUR LOCAL ELDERS</b> if you have not already done so. (Indeed,because of our position on blood, <b>it is the course of wisdom to alert ourelders anytime we have to go to a health care facility.)</b> Next, if it isdeemed necessary, THE ELDERS WILL CALL THE <b>NEAREST HOSPITAL LIAISONCOMMITTEE</b>. If you wish, some Hospital Liaison Committee members may cometo the hospital at this time to help you -Isa. 32:1, 2.</i></p> <p><i>These Hospital Liaison Committee elders know who the co-operative doctorsare in your area and can get you in touch with them and start to line upother doctors or health care centres to assist. If none are availablelocally, the elders will check with the next nearest committee. And if thatis not successful, they will call the Hospital Information Desk at Bethel.They may also be able to arrange for consultation with a co-operative doctorwho can explain to your present medical team what can be done without blood.Hospital Liaison Committee brothers have been trained to handle suchsituations.</i></p> <p><i>Members of the Hospital Liaison Committees are also willing to help you or arelative talk to a doctor or an administrator, but you must request thathelp. Of course, these brothers cannot make decisions for you, but oftenthey can assist you in considering the Society's view of matters and alertyou to your options medically and legally.</i></p> <p><i>If the medical team is still disinclined to co-operate, talk to theconsultant about a referral to another specialist who will respect yourwishes. If he hesitates to do that and ONLY if you definitely have anothersurgeon lined up elsewhere and your general practitioner is willing toarrange a referral, then you have the option of insisting on a transfer tothe other facility.</i></p> <p><i> Can you do that? Yes, you have that right. And if the matter later comes tocourt a signed and dated written statement can carry much weight. It canalso possibly open the way ethically for other surgeons now to step in andoffer their services to you. And, most important, it can get you the neededmedical attention before your condition deteriorates dangerously. Do notwait too long!</i></p> <p><i><b>LOADED QUESTIONS TO WATCH OUT FOR</b></i></p> <p><i>You should know that there are some questions that doctors and others posethat are not always asked with good motive. The one most frequently asked bydoctors (and by some judges) is:</i></p> <p><i><b>&quot;Would you rather die (let your child die) than accept a &quot;lifesavingblood transfusion&quot;?&quot;</b></i></p> <p><i>If you say yes, that would be correct in a religious sense. But that replyis often misunderstood and at times even produces adverse court decisions.You must remember that you are not in the ministry in this situation.Rather, you are talking about needed medical treatment. Hence, you mustadapt to your audience, medical or legal.-Ps. 39:1; Col. 4:5, 6.</i></p> <p><i>'To a doctor, a judge, or a hospital administrator, &quot;yes&quot; can mean you wantto be a martyr or want to sacrifice your child for your faith. Telling themabout your strong faith in the resurrection in this situation will notusually help. They will brand you a religious fanatic, unable to makerational decisions when life is at stake. In the case of children, they willsee you as a negligent parent who refuses so-called &quot;lifesaving&quot; medicaltreatment.</i></p> <p><i>But you are NOT denying medical treatment as such. You simply differ withthe doctor as to WHAT KIND of treatment. <b>This position will often changethe whole picture for them and you. Besides, it is misleading for them tomake it appear as if blood is safe and is the ONLY &quot;lifesaving&quot; treatment.(See How Can Blood Save Your Life?, pages 7-22.) So you must make that pointvery clear. How can you do it? You might answer:</b></i></p> <p><i>&quot;I do not want (I do not want my child) to die. If I wanted (wanted mychild) to die, I would have stayed at home. But I came here to get medicaltreatment so as to (to have my child) live. What I want is alternative nonblood medical management of my (my child's) case. There are alternativesavailable&quot;.</i></p> <p><i><b>Several other questions often asked by doctors or judges are:</b></i></p> <p><i>What will happen to you if a transfusion is forced by court order? Will yoube held responsible?&quot;</i></p> <p><i>Will accepting or having a transfusion forced on you cause you to be put outof your religion or be denied eternal life? How will you be viewed by yourcongregation?</i></p> <p><i>One sister responded to a judge that in such a case she would not beresponsible for what he decided. While correct from one point of view, thejudge took it to mean that since she would not he held responsible, then hewould take the responsibility for her. He ordered a transfusion.</i></p> <p><i> You must understand that in asking these questions, some are usually lookingfor a way around your refusal to accept blood. Do not inadvertently give itto them! So how would we avoid that misunderstanding? You could reply:</i></p> <p><i>&quot;If blood is forced on me in any way, it would be the same to me as beingraped. I would suffer the emotional and spiritual consequences of thatunwanted attack on me for the rest of my life. I would resist with all mystrength such a violation of my body without my consent. I would make everyeffort to prosecute my attackers just as I would in a case of rape&quot;.</i></p> <p><i>The strong, graphic impression must be made that a forced transfusion is tous a repugnant violation of our bodies. It is no casual matter. So hold yourground. Make it clear you want alternative non-blood medical management.</i></p> <p><i><b>WHAT WILL YOU DO TO BE READY?</b> </i></p> <p><i>We have reviewed some things that you need to do to protect yourself andyour family from an unwanted blood transfusion. (Later, we hope to -providemore details on handling problems that arise when infants and children arethreatened with transfusions.) We have also seen what the Society haslovingly done to provide help in a time of need. What must you do with thisinformation to be sure you are ready to face a faith-challenging medicalsituation?</i></p> <p><i>First: Have a family discussion to rehearse these matters and to work out what you will say and do, especially in an emergency.</i></p> <p><i>Next: See that you have all the documents you need.</i></p> <p><i>Then: Make it a matter of serious prayer to Jehovah to back you up in your firm resolve to 'keep abstaining from blood.' Obeying his law on blood assures us of his favour for endless Iife.-Acts 15:29; Prov. 27:11,12.</i></p> </ahref="#appendix"></font></li> </body> </html>

Philosophical and Historical Motivation</a></h2> <p> The mathematical theory of games was invented by John von Neumann andOskar Morgenstern (<a href="#Neu47">1944</a>). For reasons to be discussed later, limitations in their mathematicalframework initially made the theory applicable only under special andlimited conditions. This situation has dramatically changed, in ways wewill examine as we go along, over the past six decades, as theframework has been deepened and generalized. Refinements are still beingmade, and we will review a few outstanding problems thatlie along the advancing front edge of these developments towards theend of the article. However, since at least the late 1970s it has beenpossible to say with confidence that game theory is the most importantand useful tool in the analyst's kit whenever she confronts situationsin which what counts as one agent's best action (for her) depends onexpectations about what one or more other agents will do, and whatcounts as their best actions (for them) similarly depend onexpectations about her. </p> <p>Despite the fact that game theory has been rendered mathematically andlogically systematic only since 1944, game-theoretic insightscan be found among commentators going backto ancient times. For example, in two of Plato's texts, the<em>Laches</em> and the <em>Symposium</em>, Socrates recalls anepisode from the Battle of Delium that some commentators haveinterpreted (probably anachronistically) as involving the followingsituation. Consider a soldier at the front, waiting with his comradesto repulse an enemy attack. It may occur to him that if the defense islikely to be successful, then it isn't very probable that his ownpersonal contribution will be essential. But if he stays, he runs therisk of being killed or wounded—apparently for no point. On theother hand, if the enemy is going to win the battle, then his chancesof death or injury are higher still, and now quite clearly to nopoint, since the line will be overwhelmed anyway. Based on thisreasoning, it would appear that the soldier is better off running awayregardless of who is going to win the battle. Of course, if all of thesoldiers reason this way—as they all apparently <em>should</em>,since they're all in identical situations—then this willcertainly <em>bring about</em> the outcome in which the battle islost. Of course, this point, since it has occurred to us as analysts,can occur to the soldiers too. Does this give them a reason forstaying at their posts? Just the contrary: the greater the soldiers'fear that the battle will be lost, the greater their incentive to getthemselves out of harm's way. And the greater the soldiers' beliefthat the battle will be won, without the need of any particularindividual's contributions, the less reason they have to stay andfight. If each soldier <em>anticipates</em> this sort of reasoning onthe part of the others, all will quickly reason themselves into apanic, and their horrified commander will have a rout on his handsbefore the enemy has even fired a shot.</p> <p>Long before game theory had come along to show analysts how to thinkabout this sort of problem systematically, it had occurred to someactual military leaders and influenced their strategies. Thus theSpanish conqueror Cortez, when landing in Mexico with a small forcewho had good reason to fear their capacity to repel attack from thefar more numerous Aztecs, removed the risk that his troops might thinktheir way into a retreat by burning the ships on which they hadlanded. With retreat having thus been rendered physically impossible,the Spanish soldiers had no better course of action but to stand andfight—and, furthermore, to fight with as much determination asthey could muster. Better still, from Cortez's point of view, hisaction had a discouraging effect on the motivation of the Aztecs. Hetook care to burn his ships very visibly, so that the Aztecs would besure to see what he had done. They then reasoned as follows: Anycommander who could be so confident as to willfully destroy his ownoption to be prudent if the battle went badly for him must have goodreasons for such extreme optimism. It cannot be wise to attack anopponent who has a good reason (whatever, exactly, it might be) forbeing sure that he can't lose. The Aztecs therefore retreated into thesurrounding hills, and Cortez had his victory bloodlessly.</p> <p>These situations as recalled by Plato and as vividly acted upon byCortez have a common and interesting underlying logic. Notice that thesoldiers are not motivated to retreat <em>just</em>, or even mainly,by their rational assessment of the dangers of battle and by theirself-interest. Rather, they discover a sound reason to run away byrealizing that what it makes sense for them to do depends on what itwill make sense for others to do, and that all of the others cannotice this too. Even a quite brave soldier may prefer to run ratherthan heroically, but pointlessly, die trying to stem the oncoming tideall by himself. Thus we could imagine, without contradiction, acircumstance in which an army, all of whose members are brave, fleesat top speed before the enemy makes a move. If the soldiers really<em>are</em> brave, then this surely isn't the outcome any of themwanted; each would have preferred that all stand and fight. What wehave here, then, is a case in which the <em>interaction</em> of manyindividually rational decision-making processes—one process persoldier—produces an outcome intended by no one. (Most armies tryto avoid this problem just as Cortez did. Since they can't usuallymake retreat <em>physically</em> impossible, they make it<em>economically</em> impossible: they shoot deserters. Then standingand fighting is each soldier's individually rational course of actionafter all, because the cost of running is sure to be at least as highas the cost of staying.)</p> <p>Another classic source that invites this sequence of reasoning isfound in Shakespeare's <em>Henry V</em>. During the Battle ofAgincourt Henry decided to slaughter his French prisoners, in fullview of the enemy and to the surprise of his subordinates, whodescribe the action as being out of moral character. The reasons Henrygives allude to parametric considerations: he is afraid that theprisoners may free themselves and threaten his position. However, agame theorist might have furnished him with supplementary strategic(and similarly prudential, though perhaps not moral)justification. His own troops observe that the prisoners have beenkilled, and observe that the enemy has observed this. Therefore, theyknow what fate will await them at the enemy's hand if they don'twin. Metaphorically, but very effectively, their boats have beenburnt. The slaughter of the prisoners plausibly sent a signal to thesoldiers of both sides, thereby changing their incentives in ways thatfavoured English prospects for victory.</p> <p>These examples might seem to be relevant only for those who findthemselves in sordid situations of cut-throat competition. Perhaps,one might think, it is important for generals, politicians,businesspeople and others whose jobs involve manipulation of others,but the philosopher should only deplore its amorality. Such aconclusion would be highly premature, however. The study ofthe <em>logic</em> that governs the interrelationships amongstincentives, strategic interactions and outcomes has been fundamentalin modern political philosophy, since centuries before anyone had anexplicit name for this sort of logic. Philosophers share with socialscientists the need to be able to represent and systematically modelnot only what they think people normatively <em>ought to</em> do, butwhat they often <em>actually</em> do in interactive situations.</p> <p>Hobbes's <em>Leviathan</em> is often regarded as the founding work inmodern political philosophy, the text that began the continuing roundof analyses of the function and justification of the state and itsrestrictions on individual liberties. The core of Hobbes's reasoningcan be given quite straightforwardly as follows. The best situationfor all people is one in which each is free to do as she pleases. (Onemay or may not agree with this as a matter of psychology, but it isHobbes's assumption.) Often, such free people will wish to cooperatewith one another in order to carry out projects that would beimpossible for an individual acting alone. But if there are anyimmoral or amoral agents around, they will notice that their interestsmight at least sometimes be best served by getting the benefits fromcooperation and not returning them. Suppose, for example, that youagree to help me build my house in return for my promise to help youbuild yours. After my house is finished, I can make your labour freeto me simply by reneging on my promise. I then realize, however, thatif this leaves you with no house, you will have an incentive to takemine. This will put me in constant fear of you, and force me to spendvaluable time and resources guarding myself against you. I can bestminimize these costs by striking first and killing you at the firstopportunity. Of course, you can anticipate all of this reasoning byme, and so have good reason to try to beat me to the punch. Since Ican anticipate <em>this</em> reasoning by<em>you</em>, my original fear of you was not paranoid; nor was yoursof me. In fact, neither of us actually needs to be immoral to get thischain of mutual reasoning going; we need only think that there is some<em>possibility</em> that the other might try to cheat on bargains.Once a small wedge of doubt enters any one mind, the incentive inducedby fear of the consequences of being <em>preempted</em>—hitbefore hitting first—quickly becomes overwhelming on bothsides. If either of us has any resources of our own that the othermight want, this murderous logic will take hold long before we are sosilly as to imagine that we could ever actually get as far as makingdeals to help one another build houses in the first place. Left totheir own devices, agents who are at least sometimes narrowlyself-interested will repeatedly fail to derive the benefits ofcooperation, and will instead live in a state of ‘war of allagainst all’, in Hobbes's words. In these circumstances, humanlife, as he vividly and famously put it, will be “solitary, poor,nasty, brutish and short.”</p> <p>Hobbes's proposed solution to this problem was tyranny. The people canhire an agent—a government—whose job is to punish anyonewho breaks any promise. So long as the threatened punishment issufficiently dire—Hobbes thought decapitation generallyappropriate—then the cost of reneging on promises will exceedthe cost of keeping them. The logic here is identical to that used byan army when it threatens to shoot deserters. If all people know thatthese incentives hold for most others, then cooperation will not onlybe possible, but will be the expected norm, and the war of all againstall becomes a general peace.</p> <p>Hobbes pushes the logic of this argument to a very strongconclusion, arguing that it implies not only a government with theright and the power to enforce cooperation, but an‘undivided’ government in which the arbitrary will of asingle ruler must impose absolute obligation on all. Few contemporarypolitical theorists think that the particular steps by which Hobbesreasons his way to this conclusion are both sound and valid. Workingthrough these issues here, however, would carry us away from our topicinto complex details of contractarian political philosophy. What isimportant in the present context is that these details, as they are infact pursued in the contemporary debates, all involve sophisticatedinterpretation of the issues using the resources of modern game theory.Furthermore, Hobbes's most basic point, that the fundamentaljustification for the coercive authority and practices of governmentsis peoples' own need to protect themselves from what game theoristscall ‘social dilemmas’, is accepted by many, if not most,political theorists. Notice that Hobbes has <em>not</em> argued thattyranny is a desirable thing in itself. The structure of his argumentis that the logic of strategic interaction leaves only two generalpolitical outcomes possible: tyranny and anarchy. Sensible agents thenchoose tyranny as the lesser of two evils.</p> <p>The reasoning of the Athenian soldiers, of Cortez, and of Hobbes'spolitical agents has a common logic, one derived from theirsituations. In each case, the aspect of the environment that is mostimportant to the agents' achievement of their preferred outcomes isthe set of expectations and possible reactions to their strategies byother agents. The distinction between acting <em>parametrically</em>on a passive world and acting<em>non-parametrically</em> on a world that tries to act inanticipation of these actions is fundamental. If you wish to kick arock down a hill, you need only concern yourself with the rock's massrelative to the force of your blow, the extent to which it is bondedwith its supporting surface, the slope of the ground on the other sideof the rock, and the expected impact of the collision on yourfoot. The values of all of these variables are independent of yourplans and intentions, since the rock has no interests of its own andtakes no actions to attempt to assist or thwart you. By contrast, ifyou wish to kick a person down the hill, then unless that person isunconscious, bound or otherwise incapacitated, you will likely notsucceed unless you can disguise your plans until it's too late for himto take either evasive or forestalling action. Furthermore, hisprobable responses should be expected to visit costs upon you, whichyou would be wise to consider. Finally, the relative probabilities ofhis responses will depend on his expectations about your probableresponses to his responses. (Consider the difference it will make toboth of your reasoning if one or both of you are armed, or one of youis bigger than the other, or one of you is the other's boss.) Thelogical issues associated with the second sort of situation (kickingthe person as opposed to the rock) are typically much morecomplicated, as a simple hypothetical example will illustrate.</p> <p>Suppose first that you wish to cross a river that is spanned by threebridges. (Assume that swimming, wading or boating across areimpossible.) The first bridge is known to be safe and free ofobstacles; if you try to cross there, you will succeed. The secondbridge lies beneath a cliff from which large rocks sometimes fall. Thethird is inhabited by deadly cobras. Now suppose you wish torank-order the three bridges with respect to their preferability ascrossing-points. Your task here is quite straightforward. The firstbridge is obviously best, since it is safest. To rank-order the othertwo bridges, you require information about their relative levels ofdanger. If you can study the frequency of rock-falls and the movementsof the cobras for awhile, you might be able to calculate that theprobability of your being crushed by a rock at the second bridge is10% and of being struck by a cobra at the third bridge is 20%. Yourreasoning here is strictly parametric because neither the rocks northe cobras are trying to influence your actions, by, for example,concealing their typical patterns of behaviour because they know youare studying them. It is quite obvious what you should do here: crossat the safe bridge. Now let us complicate the situation a bit. Supposethat the bridge with the rocks was immediately before you, while thesafe bridge was a day's difficult hike upstream. Your decision-makingsituation here is slightly more complicated, but it is still strictlyparametric. You would have to decide whether the cost of the long hikewas worth exchanging for the penalty of a 10% chance of being hit by arock. However, this is all you must decide, and your probability of asuccessful crossing is entirely up to you; the environment is notinterested in your plans.</p> <p>However, if we now complicate the situation by adding a non-parametricelement, it becomes much more puzzling. Suppose that you are afugitive of some sort, and waiting on the other side of the river witha gun is your pursuer. She will catch and shoot you, let us suppose,only if she waits at the bridge you try to cross; otherwise, you willescape. As you reason through your choice of bridge, it occurs to youthat she is over there trying to anticipate your reasoning. It willseem that, surely, choosing the safe bridge straight away would be amistake, since that is just where she will expect you, and yourchances of death rise to certainty. So perhaps you should risk therocks, since these odds are much better. But wait … if you canreach this conclusion, your pursuer, who is just as rational andwell-informed as you are, can anticipate that you will reach it, andwill be waiting for you if you evade the rocks. So perhaps you musttake your chances with the cobras; that is what she must least expect.But, then, no … if she expects that you will expect that shewill least expect this, then she will most expect it. This dilemma,you realize with dread, is general: you must do what your pursuerleast expects; but whatever you most expect her to least expect isautomatically what she will most expect. You appear to be trapped inindecision. All that might console you a bit here is that, on theother side of the river, your pursuer is trapped in exactly the samequandary, unable to decide which bridge to wait at because as soon asshe imagines committing to one, she will notice that if she can find abest reason to pick a bridge, you can anticipate that same reason andthen avoid her.</p> <p>We know from experience that, in situations such as this, people donot usually stand and dither in circles forever. As we'll see later,there <em>is</em> a rational solution—that is, a best rationalaction—available to both players. However, until the 1940sneither philosophers nor economists knew how to find itmathematically. As a result, economists were forced to treatnon-parametric influences as if they were complications on parametricones. This is likely to strike the reader as odd, since, as ourexample of the bridge-crossing problem was meant to show,non-parametric features are often fundamental features ofdecision-making problems. Part of the explanation for game theory'srelatively late entry into the field lies in the problems with whicheconomists had historically been concerned. Classical economists, suchas Adam Smith and David Ricardo, were mainly interested in thequestion of how agents in very large markets—wholenations—could interact so as to bring about maximum monetarywealth for themselves. Smith's basic insight, that efficiency is bestmaximized by agents freely seeking mutually advantageous bargains, wasmathematically verified in the twentieth century. However, thedemonstration of this fact applies only in conditions of‘perfect competition,’ that is, when firms face no costsof entry or exit into markets, when there are no economies of scale,and when no agents' actions have unintended side-effects on otheragents' well-being. Economists always recognized that this set ofassumptions is purely an idealization for purposes of analysis, not apossible state of affairs anyone could try (or should want to try) toattain. But until the mathematics of game theory matured near the endof the 1970s, economists had to hope that the more closely a market<em>approximates</em> perfect competition, the more efficient it willbe. No such hope, however, can be mathematically or logicallyjustified in general; indeed, as a strict generalization theassumption was shown to be false as far back as the 1950s.</p> <p>This article is not about the foundations of economics, but it isimportant for understanding the origins and scope of game theory toknow that perfectly competitive markets have built into them a featurethat renders them susceptible to parametric analysis. Because agentsface no entry costs to markets, they will open shop in any givenmarket until competition drives all profits to zero. This implies thatif production costs are fixed and demand is exogenous, then agentshave no options about how much to produce if they are trying tomaximize the differences between their costs and their revenues. Theseproduction levels can be determined separately for each agent, so noneneed pay attention to what the others are doing; each agent treats hercounterparts as passive features of the environment. The other kind ofsituation to which classical economic analysis can be applied withoutrecourse to game theory is that of monopoly. Here, quite obviously,non-parametric considerations drop out, since there is only one agentunder study. However, both perfect and monopolistic competition arevery special and unusual market arrangements. Prior to the advent ofgame theory, therefore, economists were severely limited in the classof circumstances to which they could neatly apply their models.</p> <p>Philosophers share with economists a professional interest in theconditions and techniques for the maximization of human welfare. Inaddition, philosophers have a special concern with the logicaljustification of actions, and often actions must be justified byreference to their expected outcomes. (One tradition in philosophy,utilitarianism, is based on the idea that all justifiable actions mustbe justified in this way.) Without game theory, both of these problemsresist analysis wherever non-parametric aspects are relevant. We willdemonstrate this shortly by reference to the most famous (though notthe most typical) game, the so-called <em>Prisoner's Dilemma</em>, andto other, more typical, games. In doing this, we will need tointroduce, define and illustrate the basic elements and techniques ofgame theory. To this job we therefore now turn.</p> <h2><a name="Bas">2. Basic Elements and Assumptions of Game Theory</a></h2> <h3><a name="Util">2.1 Utility</a></h3> <p>An economic agent is, by definition, an entity with <em>preferences</em>. Gametheorists, like economists and philosophers studying rationaldecision-making, describe these by means of an abstract concept called<em>utility</em>. This refers to some ranking, on some specifiedscale, of the subjective welfare or change in subjective welfare thatan agent derives from an object or an event. By ‘welfare’we refer to some normative index of relative well-being, justified byreference to some background framework. For example, we might evaluatethe relative welfare of countries (which we might model as agents forsome purposes) by reference to their per capita incomes, and we mightevaluate the relative welfare of an animal, in the context ofpredicting and explaining its behavioral dispositions, by reference toits expected evolutionary fitness. In the case of people, it is mosttypical in economics and applications of game theory to evaluate theirrelative welfare by reference to their own implicit or explicitjudgments of it. This is why we referred above to <em>subjective</em>welfare. Consider a person who adores the taste of pickles butdislikes onions. She might be said to associate higher utility withstates of the world in which, all else being equal, she consumes morepickles and fewer onions than with states in which she consumes moreonions and fewer pickles. Examples of this kind suggest that‘utility’ denotes a measure of subjective<em>psychological</em> fulfillment, and this is indeed how the conceptwas generally (though not always) interpreted prior to the 1930s.During that decade, however, economists and philosophers under theinfluence of behaviourism objected to the theoretical use of suchunobservable entities as ‘psychological fulfillmentquotients.’ The economist Paul Samuelson (<a href="#Sam38">1938</a>) therefore set out to define utility in such a way that it becomes apurely technical concept. Since Samuelson's re-definition becamestandard in the 1950s, when we say that an agent acts so as tomaximize her utility, we mean by ‘utility’ simply whateverit is that the agent's behavior suggests her to consistently act so asto make more probable. If this looks circular to you, it should:theorists who follow Samuelson <em>intend</em> the statement‘agents act so as to maximize their utility’ as atautology, where an ‘(economic) agent’ is any entity thatcan be accurately described as acting to maximize a utility function,an ‘action’ is any utility-maximizing selection from a setof possible alternatives, and a‘utility function’ is whatan economic agent maximizes. Like other tautologies occurring in thefoundations of scientific theories, this interlocking (recursive)system of definitions is useful not in itself, but because it helps tofix our contexts of inquiry.</p> <p>Though we might no longer be moved by scruples derived from<em>psychological</em> behaviorism, many theorists continue to followSamuelson's way of understanding utility because they think itimportant that game theory apply to <em>any</em> kind of agent—aperson, a bear, a bee, a firm or a country—and not just to agentswith human minds. When such theorists say that agents act so as tomaximize their utility, they want this to be part of the<em>definition</em> of what it is to be an agent, not an empiricalclaim about possible inner states and motivations. Samuelson'sconception of utility, defined by way of <em>Revealed PreferenceTheory</em> (RPT) introduced in his classic paper (<a href="#Sam38">Samuelson (1938)</a>) satisfies this demand.</p> <p>Economists and others who interpret game theory in terms of revealedpreference theory should not think of game theory as in any way anempirical account of the motivations of some flesh-and-blood actors(such as actual people). Rather, they should regard game theory aspart of the body of mathematics that is used to model those entities(which might or might not literally exist) who consistently selectelements from mutually exclusive action sets as if they were trying tomaximize a utility function. On this interpretation, game theory couldnot be refuted by any empirical observations, since it is not anempirical theory in the first place. Of course, observation andexperience could lead someone favoring this interpretation to concludethat game theory is of little <em>help</em> in describing actual humanbehavior.</p> <p>Some other theorists understand the point of game theorydifferently. They view game theory as providing an explanatory accountof strategic reasoning. For this idea to be applicable, we mustsuppose that agents at least sometimes do what they do innon-parametric settings <em>because</em> game-theoretic logicrecommends certain actions as the ‘rational’ ones. Such anunderstanding of game theory incorporates a <em>normative</em> aspect,since ‘rationality’ is taken to denote a property that anagent should at least generally want to have. These two very generalways of thinking about the possible uses of game theory are compatiblewith the tautological interpretation of utility maximization. Thephilosophical difference is not idle from the perspective of theworking game theorist, however. As we will see in a later section,those who hope to use game theory to explainstrategic <em>reasoning</em>, as opposed to merelystrategic <em>behavior</em>, face some special philosophical andpractical problems.</p> <p>Since game theory involves formal reasoning, we must have a devicefor thinking of utility maximization in mathematical terms. Such adevice is called a <em>utility function</em>. The utility-map for anagent is called a ‘function’ because it maps <em>orderedpreferences</em> onto the real numbers. Suppose that agent <em>x</em>prefers bundle <em>a</em> to bundle <em>b</em> and bundle <em>b</em> tobundle <em>c</em>. We then map these onto a list of numbers, where thefunction maps the highest-ranked bundle onto the largest number in thelist, the second-highest-ranked bundle onto the next-largest number inthe list, and so on, thus:</p> <blockquote> bundle <em>a</em> ≫3 <p>bundle <em>b</em> ≫ 2</p> <p>bundle <em>c</em> ≫ 1</p> </blockquote> <p>The only property mapped by this function is <em>order</em>. Themagnitudes of the numbers are irrelevant; that is, it must not beinferred that <em>x</em> gets 3 times as much utility from bundle<em>a</em> as she gets from bundle <em>c</em>. Thus we could represent<em>exactly the same</em> utility function as that above by </p> <blockquote> bundle <em>a</em> ≫7,326 <p>bundle <em>b</em> ≫ 12.6</p> <p>bundle <em>c</em> ≫−1,000,000</p> </blockquote> <p>The numbers featuring in an ordinal utility function are thus notmeasuring any <em>quantity</em> of anything. A utility-function inwhich magnitudes <em>do</em> matter is called ‘cardinal’.Whenever someone refers to a utility function without specifying whichkind is meant, you should assume that it's ordinal. These are thesorts we'll need for the first set of games we'll examine. Later, whenwe come to seeing how to solve games that involve<em>randomization</em>—our river-crossing game from Part 1above, for example—we'll need to build cardinal utilityfunctions. The technique for doing this was given by <ahref="#neu47"> von Neumann &amp; Morgenstern (1944), and was anessential aspect of their invention of game theory. For the moment,however, we will need only ordinal functions. </ahref="#neu47"></p> <h3><a name="Games">2.2 Games and Information</a></h3> <p>All situations in which at least one agent can only act to maximizehis utility through anticipating (either consciously, or justimplicitly in his behavior) the responses to his actions by one ormore other agents is called a <em>game</em>. Agents involved in gamesare referred to as <em>players</em>. If all agents have optimalactions regardless of what the others do, as in purely parametricsituations or conditions of monopoly or perfect competition (see <a href="#Mot">Section 1</a> above) we can model this without appeal to game theory; otherwise, weneed it.</p> <p>We assume that players have capacities that are collectively referredto in the literature of economics as ‘rationality’. I havedeliberately used this roundabout formulation instead of just saying‘we assume that players are rational’. This reflects mystrong skepticism about the idea that there is one coherent generalbody of norms, which philosophers could discover through analysis,which captures the intricate web of uses of the family of ideas that‘rationality’ has represented in the Western culturaltradition. In any event, the economic rationality presupposed indeciding to apply game theory as a modeling tool is a vastly narrowerand more specific set of restrictions. An economically rational playeris one who can (i) assess outcomes, in the sense of rank-ordering themwith respect to their contributions to her welfare; (ii) calculatepaths to outcomes, in the sense of seeing which sequences of actionswould lead to which outcomes; and (iii) select actions from sets ofalternatives (which we'll describe as ‘choosing’ actions)that yield her most-preferred outcomes, given the actions of the otherplayers. We might summarize the intuition behind all this as follows:an entity is usefully modeled as an economically rational agent to theextent that it has alternatives, and chooses from amongst these in away that is reliably motivated by what seems best for itspurposes. (The philosopher Daniel Dennett would say: we can usefullypredict its behavior from ‘the intentional stance’.)</p> <p>Economic rationality might in some cases be satisfied by internalcomputations performed by an agent, and she might or might not beaware of computing or having computed its conditions andimplications. In other cases, economic rationality might simply beembodied in behavioral dispositions built by natural, cultural ormarket selection. In particular, in calling an action‘chosen’ we imply no necessary deliberation, conscious orotherwise. We mean merely that the action was taken when analternative action was available, in some sense of‘available’ normally established by the context of theparticular analysis. (‘Available’, as used by gametheorists and economists, should never be read as if it meant‘metaphysically’ or ‘logically’ available; itis almost always pragmatic, contextual and endlessly revisable by morerefined modeling.)</p> <p>Each player in a game faces a choice among two or more possible<em>strategies</em>. A strategy is a predetermined ‘programme ofplay’ that tells her what actions to take in response to<em>every possible strategy other players might use</em>. Thesignificance of the italicized phrase here will become clear when wetake up some sample games below.</p> <p>A crucial aspect of the specification of a game involves theinformation that players have when they choose strategies. Thesimplest games (from the perspective of logical structure) are thosein which agents have <em>perfect information</em>, meaning that atevery point where each agent's strategy tells her to take an action,she knows everything that has happened in the game up to that point. Aboard-game of sequential moves in which both players watchall the action (and know the rules in common), such as chess, is aninstance of such a game. By contrast, the example of thebridge-crossing game from Section 1 above illustrates a game of<em>imperfect information</em>, since the fugitive must choose abridge to cross without knowing the bridge at which the pursuer haschosen to wait, and the pursuer similarly makes her decision inignorance of the choices of her quarry. Since game theory is aboutrational action given the strategically significant actions of others,it should not surprise you to be told that what agents in games believe,or fail to believe, about each others' actions makes a considerabledifference to the logic of our analyses, as we will see.</p> <h3><a name="trees">2.3 Trees and Matrices&nbsp;</a></h3> <p>The difference between games of perfect and of imperfect informationis closely related to (though certainly not identical with!) adistinction between <em>ways of representing</em> games that is basedon <em>order of play</em>. Let us begin by distinguishing betweensequential-move and simultaneous-move games in terms ofinformation. It is natural, as a first approximation, to think ofsequential-move games as being ones in which players choose theirstrategies one after the other, and of simultaneous-move games as onesin which players choose their strategies at the same time. This isn'tquite right, however, because what is of strategic importance is notthe temporal <em>order</em> of events per se, but whether and whenplayers <em>know about</em> other players' actions relative to havingto choose their own. For example, if two competing businesses are bothplanning marketing campaigns, one might commit to its strategy monthsbefore the other does; but if neither knows what the other hascommitted to or will commit to when they make their decisions, this isa simultaneous-move game. Chess, by contrast, is normally played as asequential-move game: you see what your opponent has done beforechoosing your own next action. (Chess <em>can</em> be turned into asimultaneous-move game if the players each call moves on a commonboard while isolated from one another; but this is a very differentgame from conventional chess.)</p> <p>It was said above that the distinction between sequential-move andsimultaneous-move games is not identical to the distinction betweenperfect-information and imperfect-information games. Explaining whythis is so is a good way of establishing full understanding of bothsets of concepts. As simultaneous-move games were characterized in theprevious paragraph, it must be true that all simultaneous-move gamesare games of imperfect information. However, some games may containmixes of sequential and simultaneous moves. For example, two firmsmight commit to their marketing strategies independently and insecrecy from one another, but thereafter engage in pricing competitionin full view of one another. If the optimal marketing strategies werepartially or wholly dependent on what was expected to happen in thesubsequent pricing game, then the two stages would need to be analyzedas a single game, in which a stage of sequential play followed a stageof simultaneous play. Whole games that involve mixed stages of thissort are games of imperfect information, however temporally stagedthey might be. Games of perfect information (as the name implies)denote cases where <em>no</em> moves are simultaneous (and where noplayer ever forgets what has gone before).</p> <p>It was said above that games of perfect information are the(logically) simplest sorts of games. This is so because in such games(as long as the games are finite, that is, terminate after a knownnumber of actions) players and analysts can use a straightforwardprocedure for predicting outcomes. A player in such a gamechooses her first action by considering each series of responses andcounter-responses that will result from each action open to her. Shethen asks herself which of the available final outcomes brings her thehighest utility, and chooses the action that starts the chain leadingto this outcome. This process is called <em>backward induction</em>(because the reasoning works backwards from eventual outcomes topresent choice problems).</p> <p>We will have much more to say about backward induction and itsproperties in a later section (when we come to discuss equilibrium andequilibrium selection). For now, we have described it just in order touse it to introduce one of the two types of mathematical objects usedto represent games: <em>game trees</em>. A game tree is an example ofwhat mathematicians call a <em>directed graph</em>. That is, it is aset of connected nodes in which the overall graph has a direction. Wecan draw trees from the top of the page to the bottom, or from left toright. In the first case, nodes at the top of the page are interpretedas coming earlier in the sequence of actions. In the case of a treedrawn from left to right, leftward nodes are prior in the sequence torightward ones. An unlabelled tree has a structure of thefollowing sort:</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure1.gif" width="400" alt="Figure 1" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 1</strong> </blockquote> <p>The point of representing games using trees can best be grasped byvisualizing the use of them in supporting backward-inductionreasoning. Just imagine the player (or analyst) beginning at the endof the tree, where outcomes are displayed, and then working backwardsfrom these, looking for sets of strategies that describe paths leadingto them. Since a player's utility function indicates which outcomesshe prefers to which, we also know which paths she will prefer. Ofcourse, not all paths will be possible because the other player has arole in selecting paths too, and won't take actions that lead to lesspreferred outcomes for him. We will present some examples of thisinteractive path selection, and detailed techniques for reasoningthrough these examples, after we have described a situation we can use a tree tomodel.</p> <p>Trees are used to represent <em>sequential</em> games, because theyshow the order in which actions are taken by the players. However,games are sometimes represented on <em>matrices</em> rather than trees.This is the second type of mathematical object used to represent games.Matrices, unlike trees, simply show the outcomes, represented in termsof the players' utility functions, for every possible combination ofstrategies the players might use. For example, it makes sense todisplay the river-crossing game from <a href="#Mot">Section 1</a> on a matrix, since in that game both the fugitive and the hunter havejust one move each, and each chooses their move in ignorance of whatthe other has decided to do. Here, then, is <em>part of</em> thematrix:</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure2.gif" width="400" alt="figure 2" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 2</strong> </blockquote> <p>The fugitive's three possible strategies—cross at the safebridge, risk the rocks, or risk the cobras—form the rows of thematrix. Similarly, the hunter's three possiblestrategies—waiting at the safe bridge, waiting at the rockybridge and waiting at the cobra bridge—form the columns of thematrix. Each cell of the matrix shows—or, rather <em>would</em>show if our matrix was complete—an <em>outcome</em> defined interms of the players' <em>payoffs</em>. A player's payoff is simplythe number assigned by her ordinal utility function to the state ofaffairs corresponding to the outcome in question. For each outcome,Row's payoff is always listed first, followed by Column's. Thus, forexample, the upper left-hand corner above shows that when the fugitivecrosses at the safe bridge and the hunter is waiting there, thefugitive gets a payoff of 0 and the hunter gets a payoff of 1. Weinterpret these by reference to the two players' utility functions, which in thisgame are very simple. If the fugitive gets safely across the river hereceives a payoff of 1; if he doesn't he gets 0. If the fugitivedoesn't make it, either because he's shot by the hunter or hit by arock or bitten by a cobra, then the hunter gets a payoff of 1 and thefugitive gets a payoff of 0.</p> <p>We'll briefly explain the parts of the matrix that have been filledin, and then say why we can't yet complete the rest. Whenever thehunter waits at the bridge chosen by the fugitive, the fugitive isshot. These outcomes all deliver the payoff vector (0, 1). You can findthem descending diagonally across the matrix above from the upperleft-hand corner. Whenever the fugitive chooses the safe bridge butthe hunter waits at another, the fugitive gets safely across, yieldingthe payoff vector (1, 0). These two outcomes are shown in the secondtwo cells of the top row. All of the other cells are marked, <em>fornow</em>, with question marks. Why? The problem here is that if thefugitive crosses at either the rocky bridge or the cobra bridge, heintroduces parametric factors into the game. In these cases, he takeson some risk of getting killed, and so producing the payoff vector (0,1), that is independent of anything the hunter does. We don't yet haveenough concepts introduced to be able to show how to represent theseoutcomes in terms of utility functions—but by the time we'refinished we will, and this will provide the key to solving our puzzlefrom <a href="#Mot">Section 1</a>.</p> <p>Matrix games are referred to as ‘normal-form’ or‘strategic-form’ games, and games as trees are referred toas ‘extensive-form’ games. The two sorts of games are notequivalent, because extensive-form games containinformation—about sequences of play and players' levels ofinformation about the game structure—that strategic-form gamesdo not. In general, a strategic-form game could represent any one ofseveral extensive-form games, so a strategic-form game is best thoughtof as being a <em>set</em> of extensive-form games. When order of playis irrelevant to a game's outcome, then you should study its strategicform, since it's the whole set you want to know about. Where order ofplay <em>is</em> relevant, the extensive form <em>must</em> bespecified or your conclusions will be unreliable.</p> <h3><a name="PD">2.4 The Prisoner's Dilemma as an Example of Strategic-Form vs. Extensive-Form Representation</a></h3> <p>The distinctions described above are difficult to fully grasp if allone has to go on are abstract descriptions. They're best illustrated bymeans of an example. For this purpose, we'll use the most famous game:the Prisoner's Dilemma. It in fact gives the logic of the problem facedby Cortez's and Henry V's soldiers (see <a href="#Mot">Section 1 above</a>), and by Hobbes's agents before they empower the tyrant. However, forreasons which will become clear a bit later, you should not take thePD as a <em>typical</em> game; it isn't. We use it as an extendedexample here only because it's particularly helpful for illustratingthe <em>relationship</em> between strategic-form and extensive-formgames (and later, for illustrating the relationships between one-shotand repeated games; see <a href="#Repeat">Section 4</a> below). </p> <p>The name of the Prisoner's Dilemma game is derived from the followingsituation typically used to exemplify it. Suppose that the police havearrested two people whom they know have committed an armed robberytogether. Unfortunately, they lack enough admissible evidence to get ajury to convict. They <em>do</em>, however, have enough evidence tosend each prisoner away for two years for theft of the getawaycar. The chief inspector now makes the following offer to eachprisoner: If you will confess to the robbery, implicating yourpartner, and she does not also confess, then you'll go free and she'llget ten years. If you both confess, you'll each get 5 years. Ifneither of you confess, then you'll each get two years for the autotheft.</p> <p>Our first step in modeling the two prisoners' situation as a game isto represent it in terms of utility functions. Following the usualconvention, let us name the prisoners ‘Player I’ and‘Player II’. Both Player I's and Player II's utilityfunctions are identical:</p> <blockquote> Go free ≫ 4 <p>2 years ≫ 3</p> <p>5 years ≫ 2</p> <p>10 years ≫ 0</p> </blockquote> <p>The numbers in the function above are now used to express eachplayer's <em>payoffs</em> in the various outcomes possible in thesituation. We can represent the problem faced by both of them on asingle matrix that captures the way in which their separate choicesinteract; this is the strategic form of their game:</p> <!--pdf include<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>pdf include--> <blockquote> <img src="figure3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 3</strong> </blockquote> <p>Each cell of the matrix gives the payoffs to both players for eachcombination of actions. Player I's payoff appears as the first numberof each pair, Player II's as the second. So, if both players confessthen they each get a payoff of 2 (5 years in prison each). Thisappears in the upper-left cell. If neither of them confess, they eachget a payoff of 3 (2 years in prison each). This appears as thelower-right cell. If Player I confesses and Player II doesn't thenPlayer I gets a payoff of 4 (going free) and Player II gets a payoffof 0 (ten years in prison). This appears in the upper-right cell. Thereverse situation, in which Player II confesses and Player I refuses,appears in the lower-left cell.</p> <p>Each player evaluates his or her two possible actions here bycomparing their personal payoffs in each column, since this shows youwhich of their actions is preferable, just to themselves, for eachpossible action by their partner. So, observe: If Player II confessesthen Player I gets a payoff of 2 by confessing and a payoff of 0 byrefusing. If Player II refuses, then Player I gets a payoff of 4 byconfessing and a payoff of 3 by refusing. Therefore, Player I isbetter off confessing regardless of what Player II does. Player II,meanwhile, evaluates her actions by comparing her payoffs down eachrow, and she comes to exactly the same conclusion that Player Idoes. Wherever one action for a player is superior to her otheractions for each possible action by the opponent, we say that thefirst action<em>strictly dominates</em> the second one. In the PD, then,confessing strictly dominates refusing for both players. Both playersknow this about each other, thus entirely eliminating any temptationto depart from the strictly dominated path. Thus both players willconfess, and both will go to prison for 5 years.</p> <p>The players, and analysts, can predict this outcome using a mechanicalprocedure, known as iterated elimination of strictly dominatedstrategies. Player 1 can see by examining the matrix thathis payoffs in each cell of the top row are higher than his payoffsin each corresponding cell of the bottom row. Therefore, it can neverbe utility-maximizing for him to play his bottom-row strategy, viz., refusingto confess, <em>regardless of what Player II does</em>. SincePlayer I's bottom-row strategy will never be played, we can simply<em>delete</em> the bottom row from the matrix. Now it is obvious thatPlayer II will not refuse to confess, since her payoff from confessingin the two cells that remain is higher than her payoff from refusing.So, once again, we can delete the one-cell column on the right fromthe game. We now have only one cell remaining, that corresponding tothe outcome brought about by mutual confession. Since the reasoningthat led us to delete all other possible outcomes depended at eachstep only on the premise that both players are economically rational— that is, will choose strategies that lead to higher payoffsover strategies that lead to lower ones — there is very stronggrounds for viewing joint confession as the<em>solution</em> to the game, the outcome on which its play<em>must</em> converge to the extent that economic rationalitycorrectly models the motivations of the players. You should note thatthe order in which strictly dominated rows and columns are deleteddoesn't matter. Had we begun by deleting the right-hand column andthen deleted the bottom row, we would have arrived at the samesolution.</p> <p>It's been said a couple of times that the PD is not a typical game inmany respects. One of these respects is that all its rows and columnsare either strictly dominated or strictly dominant. In anystrategic-form game where this is true, iterated elimination ofstrictly dominated strategies is guaranteed to yield a uniquesolution. Later, however, we will see that for many games thiscondition does not apply, and then our analytic task is lessstraightforward.</p> <p>The reader will probably have noticed something disturbing about the outcomeof the PD. Had both players refused to confess, they'd have arrived at thelower-right outcome in which they each go to prison for only 2 years,thereby <em>both</em> earning higher utility than either receives when bothconfess. This is the most important fact about the PD, and itssignificance for game theory is quite general. We'll therefore returnto it below when we discuss equilibrium concepts in game theory. Fornow, however, let us stay with our use of this particular game toillustrate the difference between strategic and extensive forms.</p> <p>When people introduce the PD into popular discussions, one willoften hear them say that the police inspector must lock hisprisoners into separate rooms so that they can't communicate with oneanother. The reasoning behind this idea seems obvious: if the players couldcommunicate, they'd surely see that they're each better off if both refuse,and could make an agreement to do so, no? This, one presumes, wouldremove each player's conviction that he or she must confess because they'll otherwisebe sold up the river by their partner. In fact, however, this intuitionis misleading and its conclusion is false.</p> <p>When we represent the PD as a strategic-form game, we implicitlyassume that the prisoners can't attempt collusive agreement since theychoose their actions simultaneously. In this case, agreement beforethe fact can't help. If Player I is convinced that his partner will stickto the bargain then he can seize the opportunity to go scot-free byconfessing. Of course, he realizes that the same temptation will occurto Player II; but in that case he again wants to make sure he confesses, asthis is his only means of avoiding his worst outcome. The prisoners' agreementcomes to naught because they have no way of enforcing it; their promises to each otherconstitute what game theorists call ‘cheap talk’.</p> <p>But now suppose that the prisoners do <em>not</em> movesimultaneously. That is, suppose that Player II canchoose <em>after</em> observing Player I's action. This is the sort ofsituation that people who think non-communication important must havein mind. Now Player II will be able to see that Player I has remainedsteadfast when it comes to her choice, and she need not be concernedabout being suckered. However, this doesn't change anything, a pointthat is best made by re-representing the game in extensive form. Thisgives us our opportunity to introduce game-trees and the method ofanalysis appropriate to them.</p> <p>First, however, here are definitions of some concepts that will behelpful in analyzing game-trees:</p> <blockquote> <em>Node</em>: A point at which a player chooses an action. <p><em>Initial node</em>: The point at which the first action in thegame occurs.</p> <p><em>Terminal node</em>: Any node which, if reached, ends the game.Each terminal node corresponds to an <em>outcome</em>.</p> <p><em>Subgame</em>: Any connected set of nodes and branches descending uniquelyfrom one node.</p> <p><em>Payoff</em>: an ordinal utility number assigned to a player atan outcome.</p> <p><em>Outcome</em>: an assignment of a set of payoffs, one to eachplayer in the game.</p> <p><em>Strategy</em>: a program instructing a player which action totake at every node in the tree where she could possibly be called on tomake a choice.</p> </blockquote> <p>These quick definitions may not mean very much to you until you followthem being put to use in our analyses of trees below. It will probablybe best if you scroll back and forth between them and the examples aswe work through them. By the time you understand each example, you'llfind the concepts and their definitions quite natural and intuitive. </p> <p>To make this exercise maximally instructive, let's suppose thatPlayers I and II have studied the matrix above and, seeing thatthey're both better off in the outcome represented by the lower-rightcell, have formed an agreement to cooperate. Player I is to commit torefusal first, after which Player II will reciprocate when the policeask for her choice. We will refer to a strategy of keeping theagreement as ‘cooperation’, and will denote it in the treebelow with ‘C’. We will refer to a strategy of breakingthe agreement as ‘defection’, and will denote it on thetree below with ‘D’. Each node is numbered 1, 2, 3,… , from top to bottom, for ease of reference indiscussion. Here, then, is the tree:</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure4.gif" alt="Figure 4" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 4</strong> </blockquote> <p>Look first at each of the terminal nodes (those along the bottom).These represent possible outcomes. Each is identified with anassignment of payoffs, just as in the strategic-form game, with Player I'spayoff appearing first in each set and Player II's appearing second. Each ofthe structures descending from the nodes 1, 2 and 3 respectively is asubgame. We begin our backward-induction analysis—using atechnique called <em>Zermelo's algorithm</em>—with the sub-gamesthat arise last in the sequence of play. If the subgame descendingfrom node 3 is played, then Player II will face a choice between apayoff of 4 and a payoff of 3. (Consult the second number,representing her payoff, in each set at a terminal node descendingfrom node 3.) II earns her higher payoff by playing D. We maytherefore replace the entire subgame with an assignment of the payoff(0,4) directly to node 3, since this is the outcome that will berealized if the game reaches that node. Now consider the subgamedescending from node 2. Here, II faces a choice between a payoff of 2and one of 0. She obtains her higher payoff, 2, by playing D. We maytherefore assign the payoff (2,2) directly to node 2. Now we move tothe subgame descending from node 1. (This subgame is, of course,identical to the whole game; all games are subgames of themselves.)Player I now faces a choice between outcomes (2,2) and(0,4). Consulting the first numbers in each of these sets, he seesthat he gets his higher payoff—2—by playing D. D is, ofcourse, the option of confessing. So Player I confesses, and then Player IIalso confesses, yielding the same outcome as in thestrategic-form representation.</p> <p>What has happened here intuitively is that Player I realizes that if he plays C(refuse to confess) at node 1, then Player II will be able tomaximize her utility by suckering him and playing D. (On the tree, thishappens at node 3.) This leaves Player I with a payoff of 0 (ten years inprison), which he can avoid only by playing D to begin with. Hetherefore defects from the agreement.</p> <p>We have thus seen that in the case of the Prisoner's Dilemma, thesimultaneous and sequential versions yield the same outcome. This willoften not be true of other games, however. Furthermore, only finite extensive-form(sequential) games of perfect information — can be solved usingZermelo's algorithm.</p> <p>As noted earlier in this section, sometimes we must representsimultaneous moves <em>within</em> games that are otherwise sequential.(In all such cases the game as a whole will be one ofimperfect information, so we won't be able to solve it using Zermelo'salgorithm.) We represent such games using the device of <em>informationsets</em>. Consider the following tree:</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure5.gif" alt="Figure 5" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 5</strong> </blockquote> <p>The oval drawn around nodes <em>b</em> and <em>c</em> indicates thatthey lie within a common information set. This means that at thesenodes players cannot infer back up the path from whence they came; Player IIdoes not know, in choosing her strategy, whether she is at <em>b</em>or <em>c</em>. (For this reason, what properly bear numbers inextensive-form games are information sets, conceived as ‘actionpoints’, rather than nodes themselves; this is why the nodesinside the oval are labelled with letters rather than numbers.) Putanother way, Player II, when choosing, does not know what Player I has done at node<em>a</em>. But you will recall from earlier in this section that thisis just what defines two moves as simultaneous. We can thus see thatthe method of representing games as trees is entirely general. If nonode after the initial node is alone in an information set on itstree, so that the game has only one subgame (itself), then the wholegame is one of simultaneous play. If at least one node shares itsinformation set with another, while others are alone, the gameinvolves both simultaneous and sequential play, and so is still a gameof imperfect information. Only if all information sets are inhabitedby just one node do we have a game of perfect information.</p> <h3><a name="SolConEqu">2.5 Solution Concepts and Equilibria</a></h3> <p>In the Prisoner's Dilemma, the outcome we've represented as (2,2),indicating mutual defection, was said to be the ‘solution’to the game. Following the general practice in economics, gametheorists refer to the solutions of games as <em>equilibria.</em>Philosophically minded readers will want to pose a conceptual questionright here: What is ‘equilibrated’ about some gameoutcomes such that we are motivated to call them‘solutions’? When we say that a physical system is inequilibrium, we mean that it is in a <em>stable</em> state, one inwhich all the causal forces internal to the system balance each otherout and so leave it ‘at rest’ until and unless it isperturbed by the intervention of some exogenous (that is,‘external’) force. This is what economists havetraditionally meant in talking about ‘equilibria’; theyread economic systems as being networks of mutually constraining(often causal) relations, just like physical systems, and theequilibria of such systems are then their endogenously stablestates. As we will see in later sections, it is possible to maintainthis understanding of equilibria in the case of game theory. However,as we noted in Section 2.1, some people interpret game theory as beingan explanatory theory of strategic reasoning. For them, a solution toa game must be an outcome that a rational agent wouldpredict <em>using the mechanisms of rational computationalone</em>. Such theorists face some puzzles about solution conceptsthat are less important to the theorist who isn't trying to use gametheory to under-write a general analysis of rationality. The interestof philosophers in game theory is more often motivated by thisambition than is that of the economist or other scientist. </p> <p>It's useful to start the discussion here from the case of thePrisoner's Dilemma because it's unusually simple from the perspectiveof the puzzles about solution concepts. What we referred to as its‘solution’ is the unique <em>Nash equilibrium</em> of thegame. (The ‘Nash’ here refers to John Nash, the NobelLaureate mathematician who in <a href="#Nas50a">Nash (1950)</a> did most to extend and generalize von Neumann &amp; Morgenstern'spioneering work.) Nash equilibrium (henceforth ‘NE’)applies (or fails to apply, as the case may be) to whole <em>sets</em>of strategies, one for each player in a game. A set of strategies is aNE just in case no player could improve her payoff, given thestrategies of all other players in the game, by changing herstrategy. Notice how closely this idea is related to the idea ofstrict dominance: no strategy could be a NE strategy if it is strictlydominated. Therefore, if iterative elimination of strictly dominatedstrategies takes us to a unique outcome, we know that the vector ofstrategies that leads to it is the game's unique NE. Now, almost alltheorists agree that avoidance of strictly dominated strategies isa <em>minimum</em> requirement of economic rationality. A player whoknowingly chooses a strictly dominated strategy directly violatesclause (iii) of the definition of economic agency as givenin <a href="#games">Section 2.2</a>. This implies that <em>if</em> agame has an outcome that is a unique NE, as in the case of jointconfession in the PD, that must be its unique solution. This is one ofthe most important respects in which the PD is an ‘easy’(and atypical) game.</p> <p>We can specify one class of games in which NE is always not onlynecessary but <em>sufficient</em> as a solution concept. These arefinite perfect-information games that are also <em>zero-sum</em>. Azero-sum game (in the case of a game involving just two players) isone in which one player can only be made better off by making theother player worse off. (Tic-tac-toe is a simple example of such agame: any move that brings me closer to winning brings you closer tolosing, and vice-versa.) We can determine whether a game is zero-sumby examining players' utility functions: in zero-sum games these willbe mirror-images of each other, with one player's highly rankedoutcomes being low-ranked for the other and vice-versa. In such agame, if I am playing a strategy such that, given your strategy, Ican't do any better, and if you are <em>also</em> playing such astrategy, then, since any change of strategy by me would have to makeyou worse off and vice-versa, it follows that our game can have nosolution compatible with our mutual rationality other than its uniqueNE. We can put this another way: in a zero-sum game, my playing astrategy that maximizes my minimum payoff if you play the best youcan, and your simultaneously doing the same thing, is just<em>equivalent</em> to our both playing our best strategies, so thispair of so-called ‘maximin’ procedures is guaranteed tofind the unique solution to the game, which is its unique NE. (Intic-tac-toe, this is a draw. You can't do any better than drawing, andneither can I, if both of us are trying to win and trying not tolose.)</p> <p>However, most games do not have this property. It won't be possible,in this one article, to enumerate <em>all</em> of the ways in whichgames can be problematic from the perspective of their possiblesolutions. (For one thing, it is highly unlikely that theorists haveyet discovered all of the possible problems.) However, we can try togeneralize the issues a bit.</p> <p>First, there is the problem that in most non-zero-sum games, thereis more than one NE, but not all NE look equally plausible as thesolutions upon which strategically rational players would hit. Considerthe strategic-form game below (taken from <a href="#Kre90">Kreps (1990)</a>, p. 403):</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure6.jpg" alt="Figure 6" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 6</strong> </blockquote> <p>This game has two NE: s1-t1 and s2-t2. (Note that no rows or columnsare strictly dominated here. But if Player I is playing s1 then PlayerII can do no better than t1, and vice-versa; and similarly for thes2-t2 pair.) If NE is our only solution concept, then we shall beforced to say that either of these outcomes is equally persuasive as asolution. However, if game theory is regarded as an explanatory and/ornormative theory of strategic reasoning, this seems to be leavingsomething out: surely rational players with perfect information wouldconverge on s1-t1? (Note that this is <em>not</em> like the situationin the PD, where the socially superior situation is unachievablebecause it is not a NE. In the case of the game above, both playershave every reason to try to converge on the NE in which they arebetter off.)</p> <p>This illustrates the fact that NE is a relatively (logically)<em>weak</em> solution concept, often failing to predict intuitivelysensible solutions because, if applied alone, it refuses to allowplayers to use principles of equilibrium selection that, if not<em>demanded</em> by economic rationality, at least seem both sensibleand computationally accessible. Consider another example from <a href="#Kre90">Kreps (1990)</a>, p. 397:</p> <!--pdf include<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>pdf include--> <blockquote> <img src="figure7.jpg" alt="Figure 7" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 7</strong> </blockquote> <p>Here, no strategy strictly dominates another. However, Player I's toprow, s1, <em>weakly</em> dominates s2, since I does <em>at least aswell</em> using s1 as s2 for any reply by Player II, and on one replyby II (t2), I does better. So should not the players (and the analyst)delete the weakly dominated row s2? When they do so, column t1 is thenstrictly dominated, and the NE s1-t2 is selected as the uniquesolution. However, as Kreps goes on to show using this example, theidea that weakly dominated strategies should be deleted just likestrict ones has odd consequences. <a name="11">Suppose</a> we change the payoffs of the game just a bit, as follows:</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure8.jpg" alt="Figure 8" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 8</strong> </blockquote> <p>s2 is still weakly dominated as before; but of our two NE, s2-t1 isnow the most attractive for both players; so why should the analysteliminate its possibility? (Note that this game, again, does<em>not</em> replicate the logic of the PD. There, it makes sense toeliminate the most attractive outcome, joint refusal to confess,because both players have incentives to unilaterally deviate from it,so it is not an NE. This is not true of s2-t1 in the present game. Youshould be starting to clearly see why we called the PD game‘atypical’.) The argument <em>for</em> eliminating weaklydominated strategies is that Player 1 may be nervous, fearing thatPlayer II is not completely <em>sure</em> to be rational (or thatPlayer II fears that Player I isn't completely rational, or thatPlayer II fears that Player I fears that Player II isn't completelyrational, and so on ad infinitum) and so might play t2 with somepositive probability. If the possibility of departures fromrationality is taken seriously, then we have an argument foreliminating weakly dominated strategies: Player I thereby insuresherself against her worst outcome, s2-t2. Of course, she pays a costfor this insurance, reducing her expected payoff from 10 to 5. On theother hand, we might imagine that the players could communicate beforeplaying the game and agree to play <em>correlated strategies</em> so asto <em>coordinate</em> on s2-t1, thereby removing some, most or all ofthe uncertainty that encourages elimination of the weakly dominatedrow s1, and eliminating s1-t2 as a viable solution instead!&nbsp;</p> <p>Any proposed principle for solving games that may have the effect ofeliminating one or more NE from consideration as solutions is referred to as a<em>refinement</em> of NE. In the case just discussed, elimination ofweakly dominated strategies is one possible refinement, since itrefines away the NE s2-t1, and correlation is another, since itrefines away the other NE, s1-t2, instead. So which refinement is moreappropriate as a solution concept? People who think of game theory asan explanatory and/or normative theory of strategic rationality havegenerated a substantial literature in which the merits and drawbacksof a large number of refinements are debated. In principle, thereseems to be no limit on the number of refinements that could beconsidered, since there may also be no limits on the set ofphilosophical intuitions about what principles a rational agent mightor might not see fit to follow or to fear or hope that other playersare following.</p> <p>We now digress briefly to make a point about terminology. In previouseditions of the present article, we referred to theorists who adoptthe revealed preference interpretation of the utility functions ingame theory as ‘behaviorists’. This reflected the fact therevealed preference approaches equate choices with economicallyconsistent actions, rather than intending to refer to mentalconstructs. However, this usage is likely to cause confusion due tothe recent rise of <em>behavioral game theory</em>(<a href="#Cam03">Camerer 2003)</a>. This program of research aims todirectly incorporate into game-theoretic models generalizations,derived mainly from experiments with people, about ways in whichpeople differ from economic agents in the inferences they draw frominformation (‘framing’). Applications also typicallyincorporate special assumptions about utility functions, also derivedfrom experiments. For example, players may be taken to be willing tomake trade-offs between the magnitudes of their own payoffs andinequalities in the distribution of payoffs among the players. We willturn to some discussion of behavioral game theoryin <a href="#lab">Section 7.1</a>, <a href="#neuro">Section 7.2</a>and <a href="#human">Section 7.3</a>. For the moment, note that thisuse of game theory crucially rests on assumptions about psychologicalrepresentations of value thought to be common among people. Thus itwould be misleading to refer to behavioral game theory as‘behaviorist’. But then it just would invite confusion tocontinue referring to conventional economic game theory that relies onrevealed preference as ‘behaviorist’ game theory. We willtherefore switch to calling it ‘non-psychological’ gametheory. We mean by this the kind of game theory used by mosteconomists who are not behavioral economists. They treat game theoryas the abstract mathematics of strategic interaction, rather than asan attempt to directly characterize special psychological dispositionsthat might be typical in humans.</p> <p>Non-psychological game theorists tend to take a dim view of much ofthe refinement program. This is for the obvious reason that it relieson intuitions about inferences that people <em>should</em> findsensible. Like most scientists, non-psychological game theorists aresuspicious of the force and basis of philosophical assumptions asguides to empirical modeling.</p> <p>Behavioral game theory, by contrast, can be understood as a refinementof game theory, though not necessarily its solution concepts, in adifferent sense. It restricts the theory's underlying axioms forapplication to a special class of agents, individual, psychologicallytypical humans. It motivates this restriction by reference toinferences, along with preferences, that people <em>do</em>find <em>natural</em>, regardless of whether theseseem <em>rational</em>, which they frequently donot. Non-psychological and behavioral game theory have in common thatneither is intended to be normative — though both are often used totry to <em>describe</em> norms that prevail in groups of players, aswell to <em>explain</em> why norms might persist in groups of playerseven when they appear to be less than fully rational to philosophicalintuitions. Both see the job of <em>applied</em> game theory as beingto predict outcomes of empirical games <em>given</em> somedistribution of strategic dispositions, and some distribution ofexpectations about the strategic dispositions of others, that areshaped by dynamics in players' environments, including institutionalpressures and structures and evolutionary selection. Let us thereforegroup non-psychological and behavioral game theorists together, justfor purposes of contrast with normative game theorists,as <em>descriptive</em> game theorists.</p> <p>Descriptive game theorists are often inclined to doubt that the goalof seeking a<em>general</em> theory of rationality makes sense as aproject. Institutions and evolutionary processes build manyenvironments, and what counts as rational procedure in one environmentmay not be favoured in another. On the other hand, an entity that isnot rational in the minimal sense of economic rationality cannot,except by accident, be accurately characterized as aiming to maximizea utility function. To such entities game theory has no application inthe first place. </p> <p>This does not imply that non-psychological game theorists abjure allprincipled ways of restricting sets of NE to subsets based on theirrelative probabilities of arising. In particular, non-psychologicalgame theorists tend to be sympathetic to approaches that shiftemphasis from rationality itself onto considerations of theinformational dynamics of games. We should perhaps not be surprisedthat NE analysis alone often fails to tell us much of applied,empirical interest about strategic-form games (e.g., Figure 6 above),in which informational structure is suppressed. Equilibrium selectionissues are often more fruitfully addressed in the context ofextensive-form games.</p> <h3><a name="Subgame">2.6 Subgame Perfection</a></h3> <p>In order to deepen our understanding of extensive-form games, we needan example with more interesting structure than the PD offers. </p> <p>Consider the game described by this tree:</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure9.gif" alt="Figure 9" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 9</strong> </blockquote> <p>This game is not intended to fit any preconceived situation; it issimply a mathematical object in search of an application. (L and R herejust denote ‘left’ and ‘right’ respectively.) </p> <p>Now consider the strategic form of this game:</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure10.gif" alt="Figure 10" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 10</strong> </blockquote> <p>If you are confused by this, remember that a strategy must tell aplayer what to do at <em>every</em> information set where that playerhas an action. Since each player chooses between two actions at eachof two information sets here, each player has four strategies intotal. The first letter in each strategy designation tells eachplayer what to do if he or she reaches their first information set,the second what to do if their second information set isreached. I.e., LR for Player II tells II to play L if information set5 is reached and R if information set 6 is reached. </p> <p>If you examine the matrix in Figure 10, you will discover that (LL,RL) is among the NE. This is a bit puzzling, since if Player I reachesher second information set (7) in the extensive-form game, she wouldhardly wish to play L there; she earns a higher payoff by playing R atnode 7. Mere NE analysis doesn't notice this because NE is insensitiveto what happens <em>off the path of play</em>. Player I, in choosing Lat node 4, ensures that node 7 will not be reached; this is what ismeant by saying that it is ‘off the path of play’. Inanalyzing extensive-form games, however, we <em>should</em> care whathappens off the path of play, because consideration of this is crucialto what happens<em>on</em> the path. For example, it is the fact that Player I<em>would</em> play R if node 7 were reached that <em>would</em> causePlayer II to play L if node 6 were reached, and this is why Player Iwon't choose R at node 4. We are throwing away information relevant togame solutions if we ignore off-path outcomes, as mere NE analysisdoes. Notice that this reason for doubting that NE is a whollysatisfactory equilibrium concept in itself has nothing to do withintuitions about rationality, as in the case of the refinementconcepts discussed in Section 2.5.</p> <p>Now apply Zermelo's algorithm to the extensive form of our currentexample. Begin, again, with the last subgame, that descending from node7. This is Player I's move, and she would choose R because she prefersher payoff of 5 to the payoff of 4 she gets by playing L. Therefore, weassign the payoff (5, −1) to node 7. Thus at node 6 II faces a choicebetween (−1, 0) and (5, −1). He chooses L. At node 5 II chooses R. Atnode 4 I is thus choosing between (0, 5) and (−1, 0), and so plays L.Note that, as in the PD, an outcome appears at a terminal node—(4,5) from node 7—that is Pareto superior to the NE. Again, however,the dynamics of the game prevent it from being reached.</p> <p>The fact that Zermelo's algorithm picks out the strategy vector (LR,RL) as the unique solution to the game shows that it's yieldingsomething other than just an NE. In fact, it is generating the game's<em>subgame perfect equilibrium</em> (SPE). It gives an outcome thatyields a NE not just in the <em>whole</em> game but in every subgameas well. This is a persuasive solution concept because, again unlikethe refinements of Section 2.5, it does not demand ‘extra’rationality of agents in the sense of expecting them to have and usephilosophical intuitions about ‘what makes sense’. Itdoes, however, assume that players not only know everythingstrategically relevant to their situation but also <em>use</em> all ofthat information. In arguments about the foundations of economics,this is often referred to as an aspect of rationality (as in thephrase ‘rational expectations’. It is helpful to becareful not to confuse rationality in general with computational powerand the possession of budgets, in time and energy, to make the most ofit.</p> <p>An agent playing a subgame perfect strategy simply chooses, at everynode she reaches, the path that brings her the highest payoff <em>inthe subgame emanating from that node</em>. SPE predicts a game'soutcome just in case, in solving the game, the players foresee thatthey will all do that.</p> <p>A main value of analyzing extensive-form games for SPE is that thiscan help us to locate structural barriers to social optimization. Inour current example, Player I would be better off, and Player II noworse off, at the left-hand node emanating from node 7 than at the SPEoutcome. But Player I's basic economic rationality, and Player II'sawareness of this, blocks the socially efficient outcome. If ourplayers wish to bring about the more socially efficient outcome (4,5)here, they must do so by redesigning their institutions so as tochange the structure of the game. The enterprise of changinginstitutional and informational structures so as to make efficientoutcomes more likely in the games that agents (that is, people,corporations, governments, etc.) actually play is knownas <em>mechanism design</em>, and is one of the leading areas ofapplication of game theory. The main techniques are reviewedin <a href="#Hur06">Hurwicz and Reiter (2006)</a>, the first author ofwhich was awarded the Nobel Prize for his pioneering work in thearea.</p> <h3><a name="IP">2.7 On Interpreting Payoffs: Morality and Efficiency in Games</a></h3> <p>Many readers, but especially philosophers, might wonder why, in thecase of the example taken up in the previous section, mechanism designshould be necessary unless players are morbidly selfishsociopaths. Surely, the players might be able to just <em>see</em>that outcome (4,5) is socially and morally superior; and since thewhole problem also takes for granted that they can also see the pathof actions that leads to this efficient outcome, who is the gametheorist to announce that, unless their game is changed, it'sunattainable? This objection, which applies the distinctive idea ofrationality urged by Immanuel Kant, indicates the leading way in whichmany philosophers mean more by ‘rationality’ thandescriptive game theorists do. This theme is explored with greatliveliness and polemical force in Binmore (<a href="#Bin94">1994</a>, <a href="#Bin98">1998</a>).</p> <p>This weighty philosophical controversy about rationality is sometimesconfused by misinterpretation of the meaning of ‘utility’in non-psychological game theory. To root out this mistake, considerthe Prisoner's Dilemma again. We have seen that in the unique NE ofthe PD, both players get less utility than they could have throughmutual cooperation. This may strike you, even if you are not a Kantian(as it has struck many commentators) as perverse. Surely, you maythink, it simply results from a combination of selfishness andparanoia on the part of the players. To begin with they have no regardfor the social good, and then they shoot themselves in the feet bybeing too untrustworthy to respect agreements.</p> <p>This way of thinking is very common in popular discussions, and badlymixed up. To dispel its influence, let us first introduce someterminology for talking about outcomes. Welfare economists typicallymeasure social good in terms of <em>Pareto efficiency</em>. Adistribution of utility β is said to be <em>Pareto superior</em>over another distribution δ just in case from state δthere is a possible redistribution of utility to β such that atleast one player is better off in β than in δ and no playeris worse off. Failure to move from a Pareto-inferior to aPareto-superior distribution is<em>inefficient</em> because the existence of β as a possibility,at least in principle, shows that in δ some utility is beingwasted. Now, the outcome (3,3) that represents mutual cooperation inour model of the PD is clearly Pareto superior over mutual defection;at (3,3)<em>both</em> players are better off than at (2,2). So it is true thatPDs lead to inefficient outcomes. This was true of our example inSection 2.6 as well.</p> <p>However, inefficiency should not be associated with immorality. Autility function for a player is supposed to represent <em>everythingthat player cares about</em>, which may be anything at all. As we havedescribed the situation of our prisoners they do indeed care only abouttheir own relative prison sentences, but there is nothing essential inthis. What makes a game an instance of the PD is strictly and only itspayoff structure. Thus we could have two Mother Theresa types here,both of whom care little for themselves and wish only to feed starvingchildren. But suppose the original Mother Theresa wishes to feed thechildren of Calcutta while Mother Juanita wishes to feed the childrenof Bogota. And suppose that the international aid agency will maximizeits donation if the two saints nominate the same city, will give thesecond-highest amount if they nominate each others' cities, and thelowest amount if they each nominate their own city. Our saints are in aPD here, though hardly selfish or unconcerned with the social good.</p> <p>To return to our prisoners, suppose that, contrary to our assumptions,they <em>do</em> value each other's well-being as well as theirown. In that case, this must be reflected in their utility functions,and hence in their payoffs. If their payoff structures are changed sothat, for example, they would feel so badly about contributing toinefficiency that they'd rather spend extra years in prison thanendure the shame, then they will no longer be in a PD. But all thisshows is that not every possible situation is a PD; itdoes <em>not</em> show that selfishness is among the assumptions ofgame theory. It is the <em>logic</em> of the prisoners' situation, nottheir psychology, that traps them in the inefficient outcome, and ifthat really <em>is</em> their situation then they are stuck in it(barring further complications to be discussed below). Agents who wishto avoid inefficient outcomes are best advised to prevent certaingames from arising; the defender of the possibility of Kantianrationality is really proposing that they try to dig themselves out ofsuch games by turning themselves into different kinds of agents.</p> <p>In general, then, a game is partly <em>defined</em> by the payoffsassigned to the players. In any application, such assignments shouldbe based on sound empirical evidence. If a proposed solution involvestacitly changing these payoffs, then this ‘solution’ is infact a disguised way of changing the subject and evading theimplications of best modeling practice.</p> <h3><a name="trembling">2.8 Trembling Hands</a></h3> <p>Our last point above opens the way to a philosophical puzzle, one ofseveral that still preoccupy those concerned with the logicalfoundations of game theory. It can be raised with respect to any numberof examples, but we will borrow an elegant one from C. Bicchieri (<a href="#Bic93">1993</a>). Consider thefollowing game: </p> <blockquote> <img src="figure11.gif" alt="Figure 11" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 11</strong> </blockquote> <p>The NE outcome here is at the single leftmost node descending fromnode 8. To see this, backward induct again. At node 10, I would play Lfor a payoff of 3, giving II a payoff of 1. II can do better than thisby playing L at node 9, giving I a payoff of 0. I can do better thanthis by playing L at node 8; so that is what I does, and the gameterminates without II getting to move. A puzzle is then raised byBicchieri (along with other authors,including <a href="#Bin87">Binmore (1987)</a>and <a href="#Pet89">Pettit and Sugden (1989)</a>) by way of thefollowing reasoning. Player I plays L at node 8 because she knows thatPlayer II is economically rational, and so would, at node 9, play Lbecause Player II knows that Player I is economically rational and sowould, at node 10, play L. But now we have the following paradox:Player I must suppose that Player II, at node 9, would predict PlayerI's economically rational play at node 10 despite having arrived at anode (9) that could only be reached if Player I is not economicallyrational! If Player I is not economically rational then Player II isnot justified in predicting that Player I will not play R at node 10,in which case it is not clear that Player II shouldn't play R at 9;and if Player II plays R at 9, then Player I is guaranteed of a betterpayoff then she gets if she plays L at node 8. Both players usebackward induction to solve the game; backward induction requires thatPlayer I know that Player II knows that Player I is economicallyrational; but Player II can solve the game only by using a backwardinduction argument that takes as a premise the economic irrationalityof Player I. This is the <em>paradox of backward induction</em>.</p> <p>A standard way around this paradox in the literature is to invokethe so-called ‘trembling hand’ due to <a href="#Sel75">Selten (1975)</a>. The idea here is that a decision and its consequent act may‘come apart’ with some nonzero probability, howeversmall. That is, a player might intend to take an action but then slipup in the execution and send the game down some other path instead. Ifthere is even a remote possibility that a player may make amistake—that her ‘hand may tremble’—then nocontradiction is introduced by a player's using a backward inductionargument that requires the hypothetical assumption that another playerhas taken a path that an economically rational player could not choose. In ourexample, Player II could reason about what to do at node 9 conditional on theassumption that Player I chose L at node 8 but then slipped.</p> <p><a href="#Gin09">Gintis (2009)</a> points out that the apparentparadox does not arise merely from our supposing that both players areeconomically rational. It rests crucially on the additional premisethat each player must know, and reasons on the basis of knowing, thatthe other player is economically rational. This is the premise withwhich each player's conjectures about what would happen off theequilibrium path of play are inconsistent. A player has reason toconsider out-of-equilibrium possibilities if she either believes thather opponent is rational but his hand may tremble <em>or</em> sheattaches some nonzero probability to the possibility that he is noteconomically rational <em>or</em> she attaches some doubt to herconjecture about his utility function. As Gintis also stresses, thisissue with solving extensive-form games games for SEP by Zermelo'salgorithm generalizes: a player has no reason to play evena <em>Nash</em> equilibrium strategy unless she expects other playersto also play Nash equilibrium strategies. We will return to this issuein <a href="#Evo">Section 6</a> below.</p> <p>The paradox of backward induction, like the puzzles raised byequilibrium refinement, is mainly a problem for those who view gametheory as contributing to a normative theory of rationality(specifically, as contributing to that larger theory the theory of<em>strategic</em> rationality). The non-psychological game theoristcan give a different sort of account of apparently “irrational” playand the prudence it encourages. This involves appeal to the empiricalfact that actual agents, including people, must <em>learn</em> theequilibrium strategies of games they play, at least whenever the gamesare at all complicated. Research shows that even a game as simple asthe Prisoner's Dilemma requires learning by people(<a href="#Led95">Ledyard 1995</a>, <a href="#Sal95">Sally 1995</a>, <a href="#Cam03">Camerer 2003</a>, p. 265). What it means to say that people must learn equilibriumstrategies is that we must be a bit more sophisticated than wasindicated earlier in constructing utility functions from behavior inapplication of Revealed Preference Theory. Instead of constructingutility functions on the basis of single episodes, we must do so onthe basis of observed runs of behavior <em>once it hasstabilized</em>, signifying maturity of learning for the subjects inquestion and the game in question. Once again, the Prisoner's Dilemmamakes a good example. People encounter few one-shot Prisoner'sDilemmas in everyday life, but they encounter many <em>repeated</em>PD's with non-strangers. As a result, when set into what is intended tobe a one-shot PD in the experimental laboratory, people tend toinitially play as if the game were a single round of a repeatedPD. The repeated PD has many Nash equilibria that involve cooperationrather than defection. Thus experimental subjects tend to cooperate atfirst in these circumstances, but learn after some number of rounds todefect. The experimenter cannot infer that she has successfullyinduced a one-shot PD with her experimental setup until she sees thisbehavior stabilize.</p> <p>If players of games realize that other players may need to learn gamestructures and equilibria from experience, this gives them reason totake account of what happens off the equilibrium paths ofextensive-form games. Of course, if a player fears that other playershave not learned equilibrium, this may well remove her incentive toplay an equilibrium strategy herself. This raises a set of deepproblems about social learning (<a href="#Fud98">Fudenberg and Levine 1998</a>. How do ignorant players learn to play equilibria ifsophisticated players don't show them, because the sophisticated areincentivized to play equilibrium strategies until the ignorant havelearned? The crucial answer in the case of applications of game theoryto interactions among people is that young peopleare <em>socialized</em> by growing up in networksof <em>institutions</em>, including <em>cultural norms</em>. Mostcomplex games that people play are already in progress among peoplewho were socialized before them—that is, have learned gamestructures and equilibria (<a href="#Ros08">Ross 2008</a>. Novicesmust then only copy those whose play appears to be expected andunderstood by others. Institutions and norms are rich with reminders,including homilies and easily remembered rules of thumb, to helppeople remember what they are doing <a href="#Cla97">(Clark1997)</a>.</p> <p> As noted in <a href="#IP">Section 2.7</a> above, when observed behaviordoes <em>not</em> stabilize around equilibria in a game, and there isno evidence that learning is still in process, the analyst shouldinfer that she has incorrectly modeled the situation she isstudying. Chances are that she has either mis-specified players'utility functions, the strategies available to the players, or theinformation that is available to them. Given the complexity of many ofthe situations that social scientists study, we should not besurprised that mis-specification of models happens frequently. Appliedgame theorists must do lots of learning, just like their subjects.</p> <p> Thus the paradox of backward induction is only apparent. Unlessplayers have experienced play at equilibrium with one another in thepast, even if they are all economically rational and all believe thisabout one another, we should predict that they will attach somepositive probability to the conjecture that understanding of gamestructures among some players is imperfect. This then explains whyeconomically rational agents may often play as if they believe intrembling hands.</p> <p> Learning of equilibria may take various forms fordifferent agents and for games of differing levels of complexity andrisk. Incorporating it into game-theoretic models of interactions thusintroduces an extensive new set of technicalities. For the most fullydeveloped general theory, the reader is referred to <a href="#Fud98">Fudenberg and Levine (1998)</a>. </p> <h2><a name="Uncer">3. Uncertainty, Risk and Sequential Equilibria</a></h2> <p>The games we've modeled to this point have all involved playerschoosing from amongst <em>pure strategies</em>, in which each seeks asingle optimal course of action at each node that constitutes a bestreply to the actions of others. Often, however, a player's utility isoptimized through use of a <em>mixed</em> strategy, in which she flipsa weighted coin amongst several possible actions. (We will see laterthat there is an alternative interpretation of mixing, not involvingrandomization at a particular information set; but we will start herefrom the coin-flipping interpretation and then build on it in <a href="#Beliefs">Section 3.1</a>.) Mixing is called for whenever no pure strategy maximizes the player'sutility against all opponent strategies. Our river-crossing game from <a href="#Mot">Section 1</a> exemplifies this. As we saw, the puzzle in that game consists in thefact that if the fugitive's reasoning selects a particular bridge asoptimal, his pursuer must be assumed to be able to duplicate thatreasoning. The fugitive can escape only if his pursuer cannotreliably predict which bridge he'll use. Symmetry of logical reasoningpower on the part of the two players ensures that the fugitive cansurprise the pursuer only if it is possible for him to surprise<em>himself</em>.</p> <p>Suppose that we ignore rocks and cobras for a moment, and imagine thatthe bridges are equally safe. Suppose also that the fugitive has nospecial knowledge about his pursuer that might lead him to venture aspecially conjectured probability distribution over the pursuer'savailable strategies. In this case, the fugitive's best course is toroll a three-sided die, in which each side represents a differentbridge (or, more conventionally, a six-sided die in which each bridgeis represented by two sides). He must then pre-commit himself to usingwhichever bridge is selected by this <em>randomizing device</em>. Thisfixes the odds of his survival regardless of what the pursuer does;but since the pursuer has no reason to prefer any available pure ormixed strategy, and since in any case we are presuming her epistemicsituation to be symmetrical to that of the fugitive, we may supposethat she will roll a three-sided die of her own. The fugitive now hasa 2/3 probability of escaping and the pursuer a 1/3 probability ofcatching him. Neither the fugitive nor the pursuer can improve theirchances given the other's randomizing mix, so the two randomizingstrategies are in Nash equilibrium. Note that if <em>one</em> playeris randomizing then the other does equally well on <em>any</em> mix ofprobabilities over bridges, so there are infinitely many combinations of best replies. However,each player should worry that anything other than a random strategymight be coordinated with some factor the other player can detect andexploit. Since any non-random strategy is exploitable by another non-random strategy, in a zero-sum game such as our example, only the vector of randomized strategies is a NE.</p> <p>Now let us re-introduce the parametric factors, that is, the fallingrocks at bridge #2 and the cobras at bridge #3. Again, suppose thatthe fugitive is sure to get safely across bridge #1, has a 90% chanceof crossing bridge #2, and an 80% chance of crossing bridge #3. We cansolve this new game if we make certain assumptions about the twoplayers' utility functions. Suppose that Player 1, the fugitive, caresonly about living or dying (preferring life to death) while thepursuer simply wishes to be able to report that the fugitive is dead,preferring this to having to report that he got away. (In other words,neither player cares about <em>how</em> the fugitive lives or dies.)In this case, the fugitive simply takes his original randomizingformula and weights it according to the different levels of parametricdanger at the three bridges. Each bridge should be thought of as a<em>lottery</em> over the fugitive's possible outcomes, in which eachlottery has a different <em>expected payoff</em> in terms of the itemsin his utility function.&nbsp;</p> <p>Consider matters from the pursuer's point of view. She will be usingher prudent NE strategy when she chooses the mix of probabilities over thethree bridges that makes the fugitive indifferent among his possiblepure strategies. The bridge with rocks is 1.1 times more dangerous forhim than the safe bridge. Therefore, he will be indifferent betweenthe two when the pursuer is 1.1 times more likely to be waiting at thesafe bridge than the rocky bridge. The cobra bridge is 1.2 times moredangerous for the fugitive than the safe bridge. Therefore, he will beindifferent between these two bridges when the pursuer's probabilityof waiting at the safe bridge is 1.2 times higher than the probabilitythat she is at the cobra bridge. Suppose we use s1, s2 and s3 torepresent the fugitive's parametric survival rates at eachbridge. Then the pursuer minimizes the net survival rate across anypair of bridges by adjusting the probabilities p1 and p2 that she willwait at them so that</p> <blockquote> s1 (1 − p1) = s2 (1 − p2) </blockquote> <p>Since p1 + p2 = 1, we can rewrite this as</p> <blockquote> s1 &times; p2 = s2 &times; p1 </blockquote> <p>so</p> <blockquote> p1/s1 = p2/s2. </blockquote> <p>Thus the pursuer finds her prudent NE strategy by solving the followingsimultaneous equations:</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>1 (1 − p1)</td> <td>=</td> <td>0.9 (1 − p2)</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>=</td> <td>0.8 (1 − p3)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>p1 + p2 + p3 = 1.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>p1</td> <td>=</td> <td>49/121</td> </tr> <tr> <td>p2</td> <td>=</td> <td>41/121</td> </tr> <tr> <td>p3</td> <td>=</td> <td>31/121</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </blockquote> <p>Now let f1, f2, f3 represent the probabilities with which the fugitivechooses each respective bridge. Then the fugitive finds his prudent NEstrategy by solving</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>s1 &times; f1</td> <td>=</td> <td>s2 &times; f2</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>=</td> <td>s3 &times; f3</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </blockquote> <p>so</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>1 &times; f1</td> <td>=</td> <td>0.9 &times; f2</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>=</td> <td>0.8 &times; f3</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </blockquote> <p>simultaneously with</p> <blockquote> f1 + f2 + f3 = 1. </blockquote> <p>Then</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>f1 = 36/121</td> </tr> <tr> <td>f2 = 40/121</td> </tr> <tr> <td>f3 = 45/121</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </blockquote> <p>These two sets of NE probabilities tell each player how to weight hisor her die before throwing it. Note the — perhaps surprising— result that the fugitive uses riskier bridges with <em> higher</em> probability. This is the only way of making the pursuerindifferent over which bridge she stakes out, which in turn is whatmaximizes the fugitive's probability of survival.</p> <p>We were able to solve this game straightforwardly because we set theutility functions in such a way as to make it <em>zero-sum</em>, or<em>strictly competitive</em>. That is, every gain in expected utilityby one player represents a precisely symmetrical loss by the other.However, this condition may often not hold. Suppose now that theutility functions are more complicated. The pursuer most prefers anoutcome in which she shoots the fugitive and so claims credit for hisapprehension to one in which he dies of rockfall or snakebite; and sheprefers this second outcome to his escape. The fugitive prefers aquick death by gunshot to the pain of being crushed or the terror ofan encounter with a cobra. Most of all, of course, he prefers toescape. We cannot solve this game, as before, simply on the basis ofknowing the players' ordinal utility functions, since the<em>intensities</em> of their respective preferences will now berelevant to their strategies.</p> <p>Prior to the work of <a href="#Neu47">von Neumann &amp; Morgenstern (1947)</a>, situations of this sort were inherently baffling to analysts. This isbecause utility does not denote a hidden psychological variable suchas <em>pleasure</em>. As we discussed in <a href="#Util">Section 2.1</a>, utility is merely a measure of relative behavioural dispositionsgiven certain consistency assumptions about relations betweenpreferences and choices. It therefore makes no sense to imaginecomparing our players' <em>cardinal</em>—that is,intensity-sensitive—preferences with one another's, since thereis no independent, interpersonally constant yardstick we coulduse. How, then, can we model games in which cardinal information isrelevant? After all, modeling games requires that all players'utilities be taken simultaneously into account, as we've seen.</p> <p>A crucial aspect of <a href="#Neu47">von Neumann &amp; Morgenstern's (1947)</a> work was the solution to this problem. Here, we will provide a briefoutline of their ingenious technique for building cardinal utilityfunctions out of ordinal ones. It is emphasized that what follows ismerely an <em>outline</em>, so as to make cardinal utilitynon-mysterious to you as a student who is interested in knowing aboutthe philosophical foundations of game theory, and about the range ofproblems to which it can be applied. Providing a manual you couldfollow in <em>building</em> your own cardinal utility functions wouldrequire many pages. Such manuals are available in manytextbooks.</p> <p>Suppose we have an agent whose ordinal utility function is known.Indeed, suppose that it's our river-crossing fugitive. Let's assign himthe following ordinal utility function:</p> <blockquote> Escape ≫ 4 <p>Death by shooting ≫ 3</p> <p>Death by rockfall ≫ 2</p> <p>Death by snakebite ≫ 1</p> </blockquote> <p>Now, we know that his preference for escape over <em>any</em> form ofdeath is likely to be stronger than his preference for, say, shootingover snakebite. This should be reflected in his choice behaviour inthe following way. In a situation such as the river-crossing game, heshould be willing to run greater risks to increase the relativeprobability of escape over shooting than he is to increase therelative probability of shooting over snakebite. This bit of logic isthe crucial insight behind <a href="#Neu47">von Neumann &amp; Morgenstern's (1947)</a> solution to the cardinalization problem. </p> <p>Begin by asking our agent to pick, from the available set of outcomes,a <em>best</em> one and a <em>worst</em> one. ‘Best’ and‘worst’ are defined in terms of a principle of decisiontheory: an economically rational agent chooses so as to maximize theprobability of the best outcome—callthis <strong>W</strong>—and to minimize the probability of theworst outcome—call this<strong>L</strong>. Now consider prizes intermediate between<strong>W</strong> and <strong>L</strong>. We find, for a set ofoutcomes containing such prizes, a lottery over them such that ouragent is indifferent between that lottery and a lottery including only<strong>W</strong> and <strong>L</strong>. In our example, this wouldbe a lottery having shooting and rockfall as its possible outcomes.Call this lottery <strong>T</strong> . We define a utility function<em>q</em> = <em>u</em>(<strong>T</strong>) such that if <em>q</em> isthe expected prize in <strong>T</strong> , the agent is indifferentbetween winning <strong>T</strong> and winning a lottery in which<strong>W</strong> occurs with probability<em>u</em>(<strong>T</strong>) and <strong>L</strong> occurs withprobability 1&nbsp;−&nbsp;<em>u</em>(<strong>T</strong>).</p> <p>We now construct a <em>compound lottery</em> <strong>T</strong>* overthe outcome set {<strong>W</strong>, <strong>L</strong>} such that theagent is indifferent between <strong>T</strong> and<strong>T</strong>*. A compound lottery is one in which the prize inthe lottery is another lottery. This makes sense because, after all,it is still <strong>W</strong> and <strong>L</strong> that are atstake for our agent in both cases; so we can then analyze<strong>T</strong>* into a simple lottery over <strong>W</strong> and<strong>L</strong>. Call this lottery <strong>r</strong>. It followsfrom transitivity that <strong>T</strong> is equivalent to<strong>r</strong>. (Note that this presupposes that our agent doesnot gain utility from the complexity of her gambles.) The agent willnow choose the action that maximizes the probability ofwinning <strong>W</strong>. The mapping from the set of outcomes to<em>u</em>(<strong>r</strong>) is a <em>von Neumann-Morgensternutility function</em> (VNMuf).</p> <p>What exactly have we done here? We've simply given our agent choicesover lotteries, instead of over prizes directly, and observed how muchextra risk he's willing to run to increase the chances of winningescape over snakebite relative to getting shot or clobbered with arock. A VNMuf yields a <em>cardinal</em>, rather than an ordinal,measure of utility. Our choice of endpoint-values, <strong>W</strong>and <strong>L</strong>, is arbitrary, as before; but once these arefixed the values of the intermediate points are determined. Therefore,the VNMuf <em>does</em> measure the relative preference intensities ofa single agent. However, since our assignment of utility values to<strong>W</strong> and <strong>L</strong> <em>is</em> arbitrary, wecan't use VNMufs to compare the cardinal preferences of one agent withthose of another. Furthermore, since we are using a<em>risk-metric</em> as our measuring instrument, the construction ofthe new utility function depends on assuming that our agent's<em>attitude to risk itself</em> stays constant from one comparison oflotteries to another. This seems reasonable for a single agent in asingle game-situation. However, two agents in one game, or one agentunder different sorts of circumstances, may display very differentattitudes to risk. Perhaps in the river-crossing game the pursuer,whose life is not at stake, will enjoy gambling with her glory whileour fugitive is cautious. In general, a <em>risk-averse</em> agentprefers a guaranteed prize to its equivalent expected value in alottery. A <em>risk-loving</em> agent has the reverse preference. A<em>risk-neutral</em> agent is indifferent between these options. Inanalyzing the river-crossing game, however, we don't <em>have to</em>be able to compare the pursuer's cardinal utilities with thefugitive's. Both agents, after all, can find their NE strategies ifthey can estimate the probabilities each will assign to the actions ofthe other. This means that each must know both VNMufs; but neitherneed try to comparatively value the outcomes over which they'regambling.</p> <p>We can now fill in the rest of the matrix for the bridge-crossing gamethat we started to draw in Section 2. If all that the fugitive caresabout is life and death, but not the manner of death, and if all thehunter cares about is preventing the fugitive from escaping, then wecan now interpret both utility functions cardinally. This permits usto assign expected utilities, expressed by multiplying the originalpayoffs by the relevant probabilities, as outcomes in the matrix.Suppose that the hunter waits at the cobra bridge with probability<em>x</em> and at the rocky bridge with probability <em>y</em>. Sinceher probabilities across the three bridges must sum to 1, this impliesthat she must wait at the safe bridge with probability 1 −(<em>x</em> + <em>y</em>). Then, continuing to assign the fugitive apayoff of 0 if he dies and 1 if he escapes, and the hunter the reversepayoffs, our complete matrix is as follows:</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure12.jpg" alt="Figure 12" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 12</strong> </blockquote> <p>We can now read the following facts about the game directly from thematrix. No pair of pure strategies is a pair of best replies to theother. Therefore, the game's only NE require at least one player touse a mixed strategy.</p> <h3><a name="Beliefs">3.1 Beliefs</a></h3> <p>How should we interpret the processes being modeled by computations ofNE strategy mixes in games like the river-crossing one? One possiblekind of interpretation is an <em> evolutionary </em> one. If thehunter and the fugitive have regularly played games that structurally<em>resemble</em> this river-crossing game, then selection pressureswill have encouraged habits in them that lead them both to play NEstrategies <em>and to sincerely rationalize doing so</em> by means ofsome satisfying story or other. If neither party has ever been in asituation like this, and if their biological and/or cultural ancestorshaven't either, and if neither is concerned with revealing informationto opponents in expected future situations of this sort (because theydon't expect them to arise again),and if both parties aren't trainedgame theorists, then their behavior should be predicted not by a gametheorist but by friends of theirs who are familiar with their personalidiosyncrasies. The spirit of science should be comfortable with theidea that game theory isn't useful for modelling every possibleempirical circumstance that comes along.</p> <p>However, the philosopher who wants game theory to serve as adescriptive and/or normative theory of strategic rationality cannotrest content with this answer. He must find a satisfying line ofadvice for the players even when their game is alone in the universeof strategic problems, unless he is prepared to admit that rationalitymight recommend no definite course of action even in a situation whereall relevant parameters are known. No such advice can be given that is<em>uncontroversially</em> satisfactory. A non-psychological gametheorist, after all, may favor this stance <em>because</em> she isn'tsatisfied by any available approach here—and because she fearsthe effort leaves empirical science behind. However, there is a way ofhandling the matter that many game theorists have found worthy ofdetailed pursuit. This involves the computation of <em>equilibria inbeliefs</em>.</p> <p>In fact, the the non-psychological game theorist can borrow theconcept of equilibrium in beliefs for different purposes. As we'veseen, the concept of NE sometimes doesn't go deep enough as ananalytical instrument to tell us all that we think might be importantin a game. Thus even the analyst who isn't impressed with the projectof developing refinements for the sake of satisfying a prioriintuitions about the concept of rationality might make use of theconcept of subgame-perfect equilibrium (SPE), as discussed in <a href="#Subgame">Section 2.6</a>, if they think they're dealing with agents who are very well informed(say, because they're in a familiar and strongly prescriptiveinstitutional setting). But now consider the three-playerimperfect-information game below known as ‘Selten's horse’(for its inventor, Nobel Laureate Reinhard Selten, and because of theshape of its tree; taken from <a href="#Kre90">Kreps (1990)</a>, p. 426):</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure13.jpg" alt="Figure 13" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 13</strong> </blockquote> <p>One of the NE of this game is Lr<sub>2</sub>l<sub>3</sub>. This isbecause if Player I plays L, then Player II playing r<sub>2</sub> hasno incentive to change strategies because her only node of action, 12,is off the path of play. But this NE seems to be purely technical; itmakes little sense as a solution. This reveals itself in the fact thatif the game beginning at node 14 could be treated as a subgame,Lr<sub>2</sub>l<sub>3</sub> would not be an SPE. Whenever she<em>does</em> get a move, Player II should play l<sub>2</sub>. But ifPlayer II is playing l<sub>2</sub> then Player I should switch toR. In that case Player III should switch to r<sub>3</sub>, sendingPlayer II back to r<sub>2</sub>. And here's a new,‘sensible’, NE: Rr<sub>2</sub>r<sub>3</sub>. I and II ineffect play ‘keepaway’ from III.</p> <p>This NE is stable under learning by players in just the same way that a SPEoutcome in a perfect-information game is more stable than othernon-SPE NE. However, we can't select it by applying Zermelo'salgorithm. Because nodes 13 and 14 fall inside a common informationset, Selten's Horse has only one subgame (namely, the whole game). Weneed a ‘cousin’ concept to SPE that we can apply in casesof imperfect information, and we need a new solution procedure toreplace Zermelo's algorithm for such games.</p> <p>Notice what Player III in Selten's Horse might wonder about as heselects his strategy. “Given that I get a move,” he asks himself, “wasmy action node reached from node 11 or from node 12?” What, in otherwords, are the <em>conditional probabilities</em> that Player III isat node 13 or 14 given that he has a move? Now, if conditionalprobabilities are what Player III wonders about, then what Players Iand II must make conjectures about when they select <em>their</em>strategies are Player III's estimates of these conditionalprobabilities. These estimates are referred to as‘beliefs’. This usage need not require that we imagine anymental state, conscious or otherwise; a belief in this sense need onlybe an expectation implicit in behavior. Player I, to conjecture aboutPlayer III's beliefs, might conjecture about Player II's beliefs aboutPlayers III's beliefs, and Player III's beliefs about Player II'sbeliefs and so on. The relevant beliefs here are not merely strategic,as before, since they are not just about what players will <em>do</em>given a set of payoffs and game structures, but about whichdistributions of probabilities are mutually consistent given that theyare conditional on one another.</p> <p>What beliefs about conditional probability is it reasonable forplayers to expect from each other? The normative theorist might insiston whatever the best mathematicians have discovered about the subject.Clearly, however, if this is applied then a theory of games thatincorporated it would not be descriptively true of most people. Thenon-psychological game theorist should consider only expectations thata plausible natural process of biological or, in the case of people,cultural and institutional selection, might inculcate. Perhaps someagents might follow habits that respect<em>Bayes's rule</em>, which is the minimal true generalization aboutconditional probability that an agent could know if it knows any suchgeneralizations at all. Adding more sophisticated knowledge aboutconditional probability amounts to refining the concept ofequilibrium-in-belief, just as some game theorists refine NE. Suchrefinements will tend only to be empirically plausible when applied tohighly competitive markets in which it is worth players' while tointensively invest in expensive computational resources (e.g.,financial markets).</p> <p>Here, we will restrict our attention to the least refinedequilibrium-in-belief concept, that obtained when we require players' expectations toaccord with Bayes's rule. This rule tells us how tocompute the probability of an event F given information E (written‘pr(F/E)’):</p> <blockquote> pr(F/E) = [pr(E/F) &times; pr(F)] / pr(E) </blockquote> <p>We will henceforth assume that players do not hold beliefsinconsistent with this equality.</p> <p>We may now define a <em>sequential equilibrium</em>. A SE has twoparts: (1) a strategy profile &sect; for each player, as before, and(2) a <em>system of beliefs</em> μ for each player. μ assignsto each information set <em>h</em> a probability distribution over thenodes <em>x</em> in <em>h</em>, with the interpretation that these arethe beliefs of player <em>i</em>(<em>h</em>) about where in hisinformation set he is, given that information set <em>h</em> has beenreached. Then a sequential equilibrium is a profile of strategies&sect; and a system of beliefs μ consistent with Bayes's rule suchthat starting from every information set <em>h</em> in the tree player<em>i</em>(<em>h</em>) plays optimally from then on, given that whathe believes to have transpired previously is given by μ(<em>h</em>)and what will transpire at subsequent moves is given by &sect;.</p> <p>We now demonstrate the concept by application to Selten'sHorse. Consider again the uninteresting NELr<sub>2</sub>l<sub>3</sub>. Suppose that Player III assigns pr(1) toher belief that if she gets a move she is at node 13. Then Player II,given a consistent μ(II), must believe that Player III will playl<sub>3</sub>, in which case her only SE strategy is l<sub>2</sub>. Soalthough Lr<sub>2</sub>l<sub>3</sub> is a NE, it is not a SE. This isof course what we want.</p> <p>The use of the consistency requirement in this example is somewhattrivial, so consider now a second case (also taken from <a href="#Kre90">Kreps (1990)</a>, p. 429):</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure14.jpg" alt="Figure 14" width="550" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 14</strong> </blockquote> <p>Suppose that Player I plays L, Player II plays l<sub>2</sub> and Player III playsl<sub>3</sub>. Suppose also that μ(II) assigns pr(.3) to node16. In that case, l<sub>2</sub> is not a SE strategy for Player II, sincel<sub>2</sub> returns an expected payoff of .3(4) + .7(2) = 2.6, whiler<sub>2</sub> brings an expected payoff of 3.1. Notice that if wefiddle the strategy profile for player III while leaving everythingelse fixed, l<sub>2</sub> could <em>become</em> a SE strategy forPlayer II. If &sect;(III) yielded a play of l<sub>3</sub> with pr(.5) andr<sub>3</sub> with pr(.5), then if Player II plays r<sub>2</sub> his expectedpayoff would now be 2.2, so Ll<sub>2</sub>l<sub>3</sub> would be a SE.Now imagine setting μ(III) back as it was, but change μ(II) sothat Player II thinks the conditional probability of being at node 16 isgreater than .5; in that case, l<sub>2</sub> is again not a SEstrategy.</p> <p>The idea of SE is hopefully now clear. We can apply it to theriver-crossing game in a way that avoids the necessity for the pursuerto flip any coins of we modify the game a bit. Suppose now that thepursuer can change bridges twice during the fugitive's passage, andwill catch him just in case she meets him as he leaves thebridge. Then the pursuer's SE strategy is to divide her time at thethree bridges in accordance with the proportion given by the equationin the third paragraph of Section 3 above.</p> <p>It must be noted that since Bayes's rule cannot be applied to eventswith probability 0, its application to SE requires that players assignnon-zero probabilities to all actions available in extensive form. Thisrequirement is captured by supposing that all strategy profiles be<em>strictly mixed</em>, that is, that every action at everyinformation set be taken with positive probability. You will see thatthis is just equivalent to supposing that all hands sometimes tremble,or alternatively that no expectations are quite certain. A SE is saidto be <em>trembling-hand perfect</em> if all strategies played atequilibrium are best replies to strategies that are strictlymixed. You should also not be surprised to be told that no weaklydominated strategy can be trembling-hand perfect, since thepossibility of trembling hands gives players the most persuasivereason for avoiding such strategies.</p> <h2><a name="Repeat">4. Repeated Games and Coordination</a></h2> <p>So far we've restricted our attention to <em>one-shot</em> games, thatis, games in which players' strategic concerns extend no further thanthe terminal nodes of their single interaction. However, games areoften played with <em>future</em> games in mind, and this cansignificantly alter their outcomes and equilibrium strategies. Ourtopic in this section is <em>repeated games</em>, that is, games inwhich sets of players expect to face each other in similar situationson multiple occasions. We approach these first through the limitedcontext of repeated prisoner's dilemmas. </p> <p>We've seen that in the one-shot PD the only NE is mutual defection.This may no longer hold, however, if the players expect to meet eachother again in future PDs. Imagine that four firms, all making widgets,agree to maintain high prices by jointly restricting supply. (That is,they form a cartel.) This will only work if each firm maintains itsagreed production quota. Typically, each firm can maximize its profitby departing from its quota while the others observe theirs, since itthen sells more units at the higher market price brought about by thealmost-intact cartel. In the one-shot case, all firms would share thisincentive to defect and the cartel would immediately collapse. However,the firms expect to face each other in competition for a long period.In this case, each firm knows that if it breaks the cartel agreement,the others can punish it by underpricing it for a period long enough tomore than eliminate its short-term gain. Of course, the punishing firmswill take short-term losses too during their period of underpricing.But these losses may be worth taking if they serve to reestablish thecartel and bring about maximum long-term prices.</p> <p>One simple, and famous (but <em>not</em>, contrary to widespreadmyth, necessarily optimal) strategy for preserving cooperation inrepeated PDs is called <em>tit-for-tat</em>. This strategy tells eachplayer to behave as follows:</p> <ol type="i"> <li>Always cooperate in the first round.</li> <li>Thereafter, take whatever action your opponent took in the previousround.</li> </ol> <p>A group of players <em>all</em> playing tit-for-tat will never see anydefections. Since, in a population where others play tit-for-tat,tit-for-tat is the rational response for each player, everyone playingtit-for-tat is a NE. You may frequently hear people who know a<em>little</em> (but not enough) game theory talk as if this is the endof the story. It is not. </p> <p>There are two complications. First, the players must be uncertain asto when their interaction ends. Suppose the players know when the lastround comes. In that round, it will be utility-maximizing for playersto defect, since no punishment will be possible. Now consider thesecond-last round. In this round, players also face no punishment fordefection, since they expect to defect in the last round anyway. Sothey defect in the second-last round. But this means they face nothreat of punishment in the third-last round, and defect there too. Wecan simply iterate this backwards through the game tree until we reachthe first round. Since cooperation is not a NE strategy in that round,tit-for-tat is no longer a NE strategy in the repeated game, and weget the same outcome—mutual defection—as in the one-shotPD. Therefore, cooperation is only possible in repeated PDs where theexpected number of repetitions is indeterminate. (Of course, this doesapply to many real-life games.) Note that in this context any amountof uncertainty in expectations, or possibility of trembling hands,will be conducive to cooperation, at least for awhile. When people inexperiments play repeated PDs with known end-points, they indeed tendto cooperate for awhile, but learn to defect earlier as they gainexperience.</p> <p>Now we introduce a second complication. Suppose that players'ability to distinguish defection from cooperation is imperfect.Consider our case of the widget cartel. Suppose the players observe afall in the market price of widgets. Perhaps this is because a cartelmember cheated. Or perhaps it has resulted from an exogenous drop indemand. If tit-for-tat players mistake the second case for the first,they will defect, thereby setting off a chain-reaction of mutualdefections from which they can never recover, since everyplayer will reply to the first encountered defection with defection,thereby begetting further defections, and so on.</p> <p>If players know that such miscommunication is possible, they haveincentive to resort to more sophisticated strategies. In particular,they may be prepared to sometimes risk following defections withcooperation in order to test their inferences. However, if theyare <em>too</em> forgiving, then other players can exploit themthrough additional defections. In general, sophisticated strategieshave a problem. Because they are more difficult for other players toinfer, their use increases the probability of miscommunication. Butmiscommunication is what causes repeated-game cooperative equilibriato unravel in the first place. The complexities surroundinginformation signaling, screening and inference in repeated PDs help tointuitively explain the <em>folk theorem</em>, so called because noone is sure who first recognized it, that in repeated PDs,for <em>any</em> strategy <em>S</em> there exists a possibledistribution of strategies among other players such that the vectorof <em>S</em> and these other strategies is a NE. Thus there isnothing special, after all, about tit-for-tat.</p> <p>Real, complex, social and political dramas are seldomstraightforward instantiations of simple games such as PDs. <a href="#Har95">Hardin (1995)</a>offers an analysis of two tragically real political cases, theYugoslavian civil war of 1991–95, and the 1994 Rwandan genocide, asPDs that were nested inside <em>coordination games</em>.</p> <p>A coordination game occurs whenever the utility of two or more playersis maximized by their doing the same thing as one another, and wheresuch correspondence is more important to them than whatever it is, inparticular, that they both do. A standard example arises with rules ofthe road: ‘All drive on the left’ and ‘All drive onthe right’ are both outcomes that are NEs, and neither is moreefficient than the other. In games of ‘pure’ coordination,it doesn't even help to use more selective equilibrium criteria. Forexample, suppose that we require our players to reason in accordancewith Bayes's rule (see Section 3 above). In these circumstances, anystrategy that is a best reply to any vector of mixed strategiesavailable in NE is said to be <em>rationalizable</em>. That is, aplayer can find a set of systems of beliefs for the other players suchthat any history of the game along an equilibrium path is consistentwith that set of systems. Pure coordination games are characterized bynon-unique vectors of rationalizable strategies. In such situations,players may try to predict equilibria by searching for <em>focalpoints</em>, that is, features of some strategies that they believewill be salient to other players, and that they believe other playerswill believe to be salient to them. For example, if two people want tomeet on a given day in a big city but can't contact each other toarrange a specific time and place, both might sensibly go to thecity's most prominent downtown plaza at noon. In general, the betterplayers know one another, or the more often they have been able toobserve one another's strategic behavior, the more likely they are tosucceed in finding focal points on which to coordinate. </p> <p>Coordination was, indeed, the first topic of game-theoreticapplication that came to the widespread attention of philosophers. In1969, the philosopher <a href="#Lew69">David Lewis (1969)</a>published <em>Convention</em>, in which the conceptual framework ofgame-theory was applied to one of the fundamental issues oftwentieth-century epistemology, the nature and extent of conventionsgoverning semantics and their relationship to the justification ofpropositional beliefs. The basic insight can be captured using asimple example. The word ‘chicken’ denotes chickens and‘ostrich’ denotes ostriches. We would not be better orworse off if ‘chicken’ denoted ostriches and‘ostrich’ denoted chickens; however, we <em>would</em> beworse off if half of us used the pair of words the first way and halfthe second, or if all of us randomized between them to refer toflightless birds generally. This insight, of course, well precededLewis; but what he recognized is that this situation has the logicalform of a coordination game. Thus, while particular conventions may bearbitrary, the interactive structures that stabilize and maintain themare not. Furthermore, the equilibria involved in coordinating on nounmeanings appear to have an arbitrary element only because we cannotPareto-rank them; but <a href="#Mil84">Millikan (1984)</a> shows implicitly that in thisrespect they are atypical of linguistic coordinations. They arecertainly atypical of coordinating conventions in general, a point onwhich Lewis was misled by over-valuing ‘semanticintuitions’ about ‘the meaning’of‘convention’ (<a href="#Bac06">Bacharach 2006</a>, <a href="#Ros08">Ross 2008</a>).</p> <p> <a href="#Ros95">Ross &amp; LaCasse (1995)</a> present the followingexample of a real-life coordination game in which the NE are notPareto-indifferent, but the Pareto-inferior NE is more frequentlyobserved. In a city, drivers must coordinate on one of two NE withrespect to their behaviour at traffic lights. Either all must followthe strategy of rushing to try to race through lights that turn yellow(or amber) and pausing before proceeding when red lights shift togreen, or all must follow the strategy of slowing down on yellows andjumping immediately off on shifts to green. Both patterns are NE, inthat once a community has coordinated on one of them then noindividual has an incentive to deviate: those who slow down on yellowswhile others are rushing them will get rear-ended, while those whorush yellows in the other equilibrium will risk collision with thosewho jump off straightaway on greens. Therefore, once a city's trafficpattern settles on one of these equilibria it will tend to staythere. And, indeed, these are the two patterns that are observed inthe world's cities. However, the two equilibria are notPareto-indifferent, since the second NE allows more cars to turn lefton each cycle in a left-hand-drive jurisdiction, and right on eachcycle in a right-hand jurisdiction, which reduces the main cause ofbottlenecks in urban road networks and allows all drivers to expectgreater efficiency in getting about. Unfortunately, for reasons aboutwhich we can only speculate pending further empirical work andanalysis, far more cities are locked onto the Pareto-inferior NE thanon the Pareto-superior one.</p> <p>Conventions on standards of evidence and scientific rationality, thetopics from philosophy of science that set up the context for Lewis'sanalysis, are likely to be of the Pareto-rankable character. Whilevarious arrangements might be NE in the social game of science, asfollowers of Thomas Kuhn like to remind us, it is highly improbablethat all of these lie on a single Pareto-indifference curve. Thesethemes, strongly represented in contemporary epistemology, philosophyof science and philosophy of language, are all at least implicitapplications of game theory. (The reader can find a broad sample ofapplications, and references to the large literature, in <a href="#Noz98">Nozick (1998)</a>.)</p> <p>Most of the social and political coordination games played by peoplealso have this feature. Unfortunately for us all, inefficiency trapsrepresented by Pareto-inferior NE are extremely common in them. Andsometimes dynamics of this kind give rise to the most terrible of allrecurrent human collective behaviors. Hardin's analysis of two recentgenocidal episodes relies on the idea that the biologically shallowproperties by which people sort themselves into racial and ethnicgroups serve highly efficiently as focal points in coordination games,which in turn produce deadly PDs between them.</p> <p>According to Hardin, neither the Yugoslavian nor the Rwandan disasterswere PDs to begin with. That is, in neither situation, on either side,did most people begin by preferring the destruction of the other tomutual cooperation. However, the deadly logic of coordination,deliberately abetted by self-serving politicians,dynamically <em>created</em> PDs. Some individual Serbs (Hutus) wereencouraged to perceive their individual interests as best servedthrough identification with Serbian (Hutu) group-interests. That is,they found that some of their circumstances, such as those involvingcompetition for jobs, had the form of coordination games. They thusacted so as to create situations in which this was true for otherSerbs (Hutus) as well. Eventually, once enough Serbs (Hutus)identified self-interest with group-interest, the identificationbecame almost universally <em>correct</em>, because (1) the mostimportant goal for each Serb (Hutu) was to do roughly what every otherSerb (Hutu) would, and (2) the most distinctively <em>Serbian</em>thing to do, the doing of which signalled coordination, was to excludeCroats (Tutsi). That is, strategies involving such exclusionarybehavior were selected as a result of having efficient focalpoints. This situation made it the case that an individual—andindividually threatened—Croat's (Tutsi's) self-interest was bestmaximized by coordinating on assertive Croat (Tutsi) group-identity,which further increased pressures on Serbs (Hutus) to coordinate, andso on. Note that it is not an aspect of this analysis to suggest thatSerbs or Hutus started things; the process could have been (even if itwasn't in fact) perfectly reciprocal. But the outcome is ghastly:Serbs and Croats (Hutus and Tutsis) seem progressively morethreatening to each other as they rally together for self-defense,until both see it as imperative to preempt their rivals and strikebefore being struck. If Hardin is right—and the point here isnot to claim that he <em>is</em>, but rather to point out the worldlyimportance of determining which games agents are in factplaying—then the mere presence of an external enforcer (NATO?)would not have changed the game, pace the Hobbesian analysis, sincethe enforcer could not have threatened either side with anything worsethan what each feared from the other. What was needed wasrecalibration of evaluations of interests, which (arguably) happenedin Yugoslavia when the Croatian army began to decisively win, at whichpoint Bosnian Serbs decided that their self/group interests werebetter served by the arrival of NATO peacekeepers. The Rwandangenocide likewise ended with a military solution, in this case a Tutsivictory. (But this became the seed for the most deadly war on earthsince 1945, the Congo War of 1998–2006.)</p> <p>Of course, it is not the case that most repeated games lead todisasters. The biological basis of friendship in people and otheranimals is partly a function of the logic of repeated games. Theimportance of payoffs achievable through cooperation in future gamesleads those who expect to interact in them to be less selfish thantemptation would otherwise encourage in present games. The fact thatsuch equilibria become more stable through learning gives friends thelogical character of built-up investments, which most people takegreat pleasure in sentimentalizing. Furthermore, cultivating sharedinterests and sentiments provides networks of focal points aroundwhich coordination can be increasingly facilitated.</p> <h2><a name="Com">5. Commitment</a></h2> <p>In some games, a player can improve her outcome by taking an actionthat makes it impossible for her to take what would be her bestaction in the corresponding simultaneous-move game. Such actions arereferred to as <em>commitments</em>, and they can serve asalternatives to external enforcement in games which would otherwisesettle on Pareto-inefficient equilibria.</p> <p>Consider the following hypothetical example (which is <em>not</em> aPD). Suppose you own a piece of land adjacent to mine, and I'd like tobuy it so as to expand my lot. Unfortunately, you don't want to sellat the price I'm willing to pay. If we move simultaneously—youpost a selling price and I independently give my agent an askingprice—there will be no sale. So I might try to change yourincentives by playing an opening move in which I announce that I'llbuild a putrid-smelling sewage disposal plant on my land beside yoursunless you sell, thereby inducing you to lower your price. I've nowturned this into a sequential-move game. However, this move so farchanges nothing. If you refuse to sell in the face of my threat, it isthen not in my interest to carry it out, because in damaging you Ialso damage myself. Since you know this you should ignore mythreat. My threat is <em>incredible</em>, a case of cheap talk.</p> <p>However, I could make my threat credible by <em>committing</em>myself. For example, I could sign a contract with some farmerspromising to supply them with treated sewage (fertilizer) from myplant, but including an escape clause in the contract releasing mefrom my obligation only if I can double my lot size and so put it tosome other use. Now my threat is credible: if you don't sell, I'mcommitted to building the sewage plant. Since you know this, you nowhave an incentive to sell me your land in order to escape itsruination.</p> <p>This sort of case exposes one of many fundamental differences betweenthe logic of non-parametric and parametric maximization. In parametricsituations, an agent can never be made worse off by having moreoptions. (Even if a new option is worse than the options with whichshe began, she can just ignore it.) But where circumstances arenon-parametric, one agent's strategy can be influenced in another'sfavour if options are visibly restricted. Cortez's burning of hisboats (see <a href="#Mot">Section 1</a>) is, of course, an instance of this, one which serves to make theusual metaphor literal.</p> <p>Another example will illustrate this, as well as the applicability ofprinciples across game-types. Here we will build an imaginarysituation that is not a PD—since only one player has anincentive to defect—but which is a social dilemma insofar as itsNE in the absence of commitment is Pareto-inferior to an outcome thatis achievable <em>with</em> a commitment device. Suppose that two ofus wish to poach a rare antelope from a national park in order to sellthe trophy. One of us must flush the animal down towards the secondperson, who waits in a blind to shoot it and load it onto a truck. Youpromise, of course, to share the proceeds with me. However, yourpromise is not credible. Once you've got the buck, you have no reasonnot to drive it away and pocket the full value from it. After all, Ican't very well complain to the police without getting myself arrestedtoo. But now suppose I add the following opening move to thegame. Before our hunt, I rig out the truck with an alarm that can beturned off only by punching in a code. Only I know the code. If youtry to drive off without me, the alarm will sound and we'll both getcaught. You, knowing this, now have an incentive to wait for me. Whatis crucial to notice here is that you <em>prefer</em> that I rig upthe alarm, since this makes your promise to give me my sharecredible. If I don't do this, leaving your promise<em>in</em>credible, we'll be unable to agree to try the crime in thefirst place, and both of us will lose our shot at the profit fromselling the trophy. Thus, you benefit from my preventing you fromdoing what's optimal for you in a subgame.</p> <p>We may now combine our analysis of PDs and commitment devices indiscussion of the application that first made game theory famousoutside of the academic community. The nuclear stand-off between thesuperpowers during the Cold War was exhaustively studied by the firstgeneration of game theorists, many of whom worked for the US military.(See <a href="#Pou92">Poundstone 1992</a> for historical details.) Boththe USA and the USSR maintained the following policy. If one sidelaunched a first strike, the other threatened to answer with adevastating counter-strike. This pair of reciprocal strategies, whichby the late 1960s would effectively have meant blowing up the world,was known as ‘Mutually Assured Destruction’, or‘MAD’. Game theorists objected that MAD was mad, becauseit set up a PD as a result of the fact that the reciprocal threatswere incredible. The reasoning behind this diagnosis went asfollows. Suppose the USSR launches a first strike against the USA. Atthat point, the American President finds his country alreadydestroyed. He doesn't bring it back to life by now blowing up theworld, so he has no incentive to carry out his original threat toretaliate, which has now manifestly failed to achieve its point. Sincethe Russians can anticipate this, they should ignore the threat toretaliate and strike first. Of course, the Americans are in an exactlysymmetric position, so they too should strike first. Each power willrecognize this incentive on the part of the other, and so willanticipate an attack if they don't rush to preempt it. What we shouldtherefore expect, because it is the only NE of the game, is a racebetween the two powers to be the first to attack.</p> <p>This game-theoretic analysis caused genuine consternation and fear onboth sides during the Cold War, and is reputed to have produced somestriking attempts at setting up strategic commitment devices. Someanecdotes, for example, allege that President Nixon had the CIA try toconvince the Russians that he was insane or frequently drunk, so thatthey'd believe that he'd launch a retaliatory strike even when it wasno longer in his interest to do so. Similarly, the Soviet KGB isclaimed to have fabricated medical reports exaggerating Brezhnev'ssenility with the same end in mind. Ultimately, the strategic symmetrythat concerned the Pentagon's analysts was complicated and perhapsbroken by changes in American missile deployment tactics. They equippeda worldwide fleet of submarines with enough missiles to destroy theUSSR. This made the reliability of their communications network lessstraightforward, and in so doing introduced an element ofstrategically relevant uncertainty. The President probably could beless sure to be able to reach the submarines and cancel their ordersto attack if any Soviet missile crossed the radar trigger line inNorthern Canada. Of course, the value of this in breaking symmetrydepended on the Russians being aware of the potential problem. InStanley Kubrick's classic film <em>Dr. Strangelove</em>, the world isdestroyed by accident because the Russians build a doomsday machinethat will automatically trigger a retaliatory strike regardless oftheir leadership's resolve to follow through on the implicit MADthreat <em>but then keep it a secret</em>. As a result, when anunequivocally mad American colonel launches missiles at Russia on hisown accord, and the American President tries to convince his Sovietcounterpart that the attack was unintended, the Russian Premiersheepishly tells him about the secret doomsday machine. Now the twoleaders can do nothing but watch in dismay as the world is blown updue to a game-theoretic mistake.</p> <p>This example of the Cold War standoff, while famous and ofconsiderable importance in the history of game theory and its popularreception, relied at the time on analyses that weren't verysubtle. The military game theorists were almost certainly mistaken tothe extent that they modeled the Cold War as a one-shot PD in thefirst place. For one thing, the nuclear balancing game was enmeshed inlarger global power games of great complexity. For another, it is farfrom clear that, for either superpower, annihilating the other whileavoiding self-annihilation was in fact the highest-ranked outcome. Ifit wasn't, in either or both cases, then the game wasn't a PD. A wisecynic might suggest that the operations researchers on both sides wereplaying a cunning strategy in a game over funding, one that involvedthem cooperating with one another in order to convince theirpoliticians to allocate more resources to weapons.</p> <p>In more mundane circumstances, most people exploit a ubiquitouscommitment device that Adam Smith long ago made the centerpiece of histheory of social order: the value to people of theirown <em>reputations</em>. Even if I am secretly stingy, I may wishothers to think me generous by tipping in restaurants, includingrestaurants in which I never intend to eat again. The more I do thissort of thing, the more I invest in a valuable reputation which Icould badly damage through a single act of obvious, and observed,mean-ness. Thus my hard-earned reputation for generosity functions asa commitment mechanism in specific games, itself enforcing continuedre-investment. There is a good deal of evidence that the thehyper-sociality of humans is supported by evolved biologicaldispositions (found in most but not all people) to suffer emotionallyfrom negative gossip and the fear of it. People are also naturallydisposed to <em>enjoy</em> gossiping, which means that punishingothers by spreading the news when their commitment devices fail is aform of social policing they don't find costly and happily take up. Anice feature of this form of punishment is that it can, unlike (say)hitting people with sticks, be withdrawn without leaving long-termdamage to the punishee. This is a happy property of a device that hasas its point the maintenance of incentives to contribute to jointsocial projects; collaboration is generally more fruitful withteam-mates whose bones aren't broken. Thus forgiveness conventionsalso play a strategic role in this extremely elegant commitmentmechanism that natural selection built for us. Finally, <em>norms</em>are culturally evolved mutual expectations in a group of people (or,for that matter, elephants or dolphins or monkeys) that have thefurther property that individuals who violate them maypunish <em>themselves</em> by feeling guilt or shame. Thus they mayoften take cooperative actions against their narrow self-interest evenwhen no one else is paying attention. Religious stories, or bogusphilosophical ones involving Kantian 'rationality', are especiallylikely to be told in explanation of norms because the underlyinggame-theoretic basis doesn't occur to people.</p> <p>Though the so-called ‘moral emotions’are extremely usefulfor maintaining commitment, they are not necessary for it. Largerhuman institutions are, famously, highly morally obtuse; however,commitment is typically crucial to their functional logic. Forexample, a government tempted to negotiate with terrorists to securethe release of hostages on a particular occasion may commit to a‘line in the sand’ strategy for the sake of maintaining areputation for toughness intended to reduce terrorists' incentives tolaunch future attacks. A different sort of example is provided byQantas Airlines of Australia. Qantas has never suffered an accident,and makes much of this in its advertising. This means that its planesprobably <em>are</em> safer than average even if the initial advantagewas merely a bit of statistical good fortune, because the value of itsability to claim a perfect record rises the longer it lasts, and sogives the airline continuous incentives to incur greater costs insafety assurance.</p> <p>Certain conditions must hold if reputation effects are to underwritecommitment. First, the game must be repeated. Reputation has nostrategic value in a one-shot game. Second, the value of thereputation must be greater to its cultivator than the value to him ofsacrificing it in <em>any</em> particular round of the repeatedgame. Thus players may establish commitment by reducing the value ofeach round so that the temptation to defect in any round never getshigh enough to constitute a hard-to-resist temptation. For example,parties to a contract may exchange their obligations in smallincrements to reduce incentives on both sides to renege. Thus buildersin construction projects may be paid in weekly or monthlyinstallments. Similarly, the International Monetary Fund oftendispenses loans to governments in small tranches, thereby reducinggovernments' incentives to violate loan conditions once the money isin hand; and governments may actually prefer such arrangements inorder to remove domestic political pressure for non-compliant use ofthe money. Of course, we are all familiar with cases in which thepayoff from a defection in a current round becomes too great relativeto the longer-run value of reputation to future cooperation, and weawake to find that the society treasurer has absconded overnight withthe funds. Commitment through concern for reputation is the cement ofsociety, but any such natural bonding agent will be far from perfectlyeffective.</p> <h2><a name="Evo">6. Evolutionary Game Theory</a></h2> <p> <a href="#Gin00">Gintis (2000</a>, <a href="#Gin09">2009</a>) feels justified in stating that “game theory is auniversal language for the unification of the behavioral sciences.”This may seem to many as if it must be a considerable rhetoricalexaggeration, but in my opinion it is entirely plausible. There aregood examples of such unifying work. Binmore(<a href="#Bin98">1998</a>, <a href="#Bin05a">2005a</a>) models social history as a series of convergences on increasinglyefficient equilibria in commonly encountered transaction games,interrupted by episodes in which some people try to shift to newequilibria by moving off stable equilibrium paths, resulting inperiodic catastrophes. (Stalin, for example, tried to shift hissociety to a set of equilibria in which people cared more about thefuture industrial, military and political power of their state thanthey cared about their own lives. He was not successful; however, hisefforts certainly created a situation in which, for a few decades,many Soviet people attached far less importance to <em>otherpeople's</em> lives than usual.) Furthermore, applications of gametheory to behavioral topics extend well beyond the politicalarena. In <a href="#Repeat">Section 4</a>, for example, we consideredLewis's recognition that each human language amounts to a network ofNash equilibria in coordination games around conveyance ofinformation.</p> <p>Given his work's vintage, Lewis restricted his attention to staticgame theory, in which agents are modeled asdeliberately <em>choosing</em> strategies given exogenously fixedutility-functions. As a result of this restriction, his accountinvited some philosophers to pursue a misguided quest for a generalanalytic theory of the rationality of conventions(<a href="#Bic08">Bickhard 2008</a>). Though Ken Binmore hascriticized this focus repeatedly through a career's worth ofcontributions (see the references for aselection), <a href="#Gin09">Gintis (2009)</a> has recently isolatedthe underlying problem with particular clarity and tenacity. NE andSPE are <em>brittle</em> solution concepts when applied to naturallyevolved computational mechanisms like animal (including human)brains. As we saw in <a href="#Uncer">Section 3</a> above, incoordination (and other) games with multiple NE, what it iseconomically rational for a player to do is highly sensitive to thelearning states of other players. In general, when players findthemselves in games where they do not have strictly dominantstrategies, they only have uncomplicated incentives to play NE or SPEstrategies to the extent that other players can be expected tofind <em>their</em> NE or SPE strategies. Can a <em>general</em>theory of strategic rationality, of the sort that philosophers havesought, be reasonably expected to cover the resulting contingencies?Resort to Bayesian reasoning principles, as we reviewedin <a href="#Beliefs">Section 3.1</a>, is the standard way of tryingto incorporate such uncertainty into theories of rational, strategicdecision. However, as <a href="#Bin09">Binmore (2009)</a> shows withbeautiful clarity in a recent book, Bayesian principles are onlyplausible <em>as principles of rationality itself</em> in so-called‘small worlds’, that is, environments in whichdistributions of risk are quantified in a set of known and enumerableparameters, as in the solution our river crossing gamefrom <a href="#Uncer">Section 3</a>. In large worlds, where utilityfunctions, strategy sets and informational structure are difficult toestimate and subject to change by contingent exogenous influences, theidea that Bayes's rule tells players how to ‘be rational’is quite implausible. But then why should we expect players to chooseNE or SPE or sequential-equilibrium strategies?</p> <p>As <a href="#Bin09">Binmore (2009)</a> and <a href="#Gin09">Gintis (2009)</a> both stress, if game theory is to be used to model actual,natural behavior and its history, outside of the small-world settingson which microeconomists (but not macroeconomists or politicalscientists or sociologists or philosophers of science) mainly traffic,then we need some account of what is attractive about equilibria ingames even when no analysis can identify them by taming alluncertainty in such a way that it can be represented as pure risk. Tomake reference again to Lewis's topic, when human language developedthere was no external referee to care about and arrange forPareto-efficiency by providing focal points for coordination. Yetsomehow people agreed, within linguistic communities, to use roughlythe same words and constructions to say similar things. It seemsunlikely that any explicit, deliberate strategizing on anyone's partplayed a role in these processes. Nevertheless, game theory has turnedout to furnish the essential concepts for understanding stabilizationof languages. This is a striking point of support for Gintis'soptimism about the reach of game theory. To understand it, we mustextend our attention to <em>evolutionary</em> games.</p> <p>Game theory has been fruitfully applied in evolutionary biology,where species and/or genes are treated as players, since pioneeringwork by <a href="#May82">Maynard Smith (1982)</a> and his collaborators. Evolutionary (or <em>dynamic</em>) game theorynow constitutes a significant new mathematical extension applicable tomany settings apart from the biological. <a href="#Sky96">Skyrms (1996)</a>uses evolutionary game theory to try to answer questions Lewis couldnot even ask, about the conditions under which language, concepts ofjustice, the notion of private property, and other non-designed,general phenomena of interest to philosophers would be likely toarise. What is novel about evolutionary game theory is that moves arenot chosen by economically rational agents. Instead, agents aretypically hard-wired with particular strategies, and success for astrategy is defined in terms of the number of copies of itself that itwill leave to play in the games of succeeding generations, given apopulation in which other strategies with which it acts aredistributed at particular frequencies. In this kind of problemsetting, the strategies themselves are the players, and individualswho play these strategies are their mere executors who receive theimmediate-run costs and benefits associated with outcomes.</p> <p>The discussion here will closely follow Skyrms's. We begin byintroducing <em>the replicator dynamics</em>. Consider first hownatural selection works to change lineages of animals, modifying,creating and destroying species. The basic mechanism is<em>differential reproduction</em>. Any animal with <em>heritable</em>features that increase its <em>expected number of offspring</em> in agiven environment will tend to leave more offspring than others solong as the environment remains relatively stable. These offspringwill be more likely to inherit the features in question. Therefore,the proportion of these features in the population will graduallyincrease as generations pass. Some of these features may <em>go tofixation</em>, that is, eventually take over the entire population(until the environment changes).</p> <p>How does game theory enter into this? Often, one of the most importantaspects of an organism's environment will be the behaviouraltendencies of other organisms. We can think of each lineage as‘trying’ to maximize its reproductive fitness (= expectednumber of grandchildren) through finding strategies that are optimalgiven the strategies of other lineages. So evolutionary theory isanother domain of application for non-parametric analysis.</p> <p>In evolutionary game theory, we no longer think of individuals as choosingstrategies as they move from one game to another. This is because ourinterests are different. We're now concerned less with finding theequilibria of single games than with discovering which equilibria arestable, and how they will change over time. So we now model <em>thestrategies themselves</em> as playing against each other. Onestrategy is ‘better’ than another if it is likely to leavemore copies of itself in the next generation, when the game will beplayed again. We study the changes in distribution of strategies inthe population as the sequence of games unfolds.</p> <p>For dynamic game theory, we introduce a new equilibrium concept, dueto <a href="#May82">Maynard Smith (1982)</a>. A set of strategies, in some particular proportion (e.g., 1/3:2/3,1/2:1/2, 1/9:8/9, 1/3:1/3:1/6:1/6—always summing to 1) is at an<em>ESS</em> (Evolutionary Stable Strategy) equilibrium just in case(1) no individual playing one strategy could improve its reproductivefitness by switching to one of the other strategies in the proportion,and (2) no mutant playing a different strategy altogether couldestablish itself (‘invade’) in the population.</p> <p>The principles of evolutionary game theory are best explained throughexamples. Skyrms begins by investigating the conditions under which asense of justice—understood as a disposition to view equaldivisions of resources as fair unless efficiency considerationssuggest otherwise in special cases—might arise. He asks us toconsider a population in which individuals regularly meet each otherand must bargain over resources. Begin with three types ofindividuals:</p> <ol type="a"> <li><em>Fairmen</em> always demand exactly half the resource.</li> <li><em>Greedies</em> always demand more than half the resource. When agreedy encounters another greedy, they waste the resource in fightingover it.</li> <li><em>Modests</em> always demand less than half the resource. When amodest encounters another modest, they take less than all of theavailable resource and waste some.</li> </ol> <p>Each <em>single</em> encounter where the total demands sum to 100% is aNE of that individual game. Similarly, there can be many dynamicequilibria. Suppose that Greedies demand 2/3 of the resource andModests demand 1/3. Then the following two proportions are ESS's: </p> <ol type="i"> <li>Half the population is greedy and half is modest. We can calculatethe average payoff here. Modest gets 1/3 of the resource in everyencounter. Greedy gets 2/3 when she meets Modest, but nothing when shemeets another Greedy. So her average payoff is also 1/3. This is anESS because Fairman can't invade. When Fairman meets Modest he gets1/2. But when Fairman meets Greedy he gets nothing. So his averagepayoff is only 1/4. No Modest has an incentive to change strategies,and neither does any Greedy. A mutant Fairman arising in thepopulation would do worst of all, and so selection will not encouragethe propagation of any such mutants.</li> <li>All players are Fairmen. Everyone always gets half the resource,and no one can do better by switching to another strategy. Greediesentering this population encounter Fairmen and get an average payoffof 0. Modests get 1/3 as before, but this is less than Fairman'spayoff of 1/2.</li> </ol> <p>Notice that equilibrium (i) is inefficient, since the average payoffacross the whole population is smaller. However, just as inefficientoutcomes can be NE of static games, so they can be ESS's of dynamicones. </p> <p>We refer to equilibria in which more than one strategy occurs as<em>polymorphisms</em>. In general, in Skyrms's game, any polymorphismin which Greedy demands <em>x</em> and Modest demands1−<em>x</em> is an ESS. The question that interests the studentof justice concerns the relative likelihood with which these differentequilibria arise.</p> <p>This depends entirely on the proportions of strategies in the originalpopulation state. If the population begins with more than one Fairman,then there is some probability that Fairmen will encounter each other,and get the highest possible average payoff. Modests by themselves donot inhibit the spread of Fairmen; only Greedies do. But Greediesthemselves depend on having Modests around in order to be viable. Sothe more Fairmen there are in the population relative to<em>pairs</em> of Greedies and Modests, the better Fairmen do onaverage. This implies a threshold effect. If the proportion of Fairmendrops below 33%, then the tendency will be for them to fall toextinction because they don't meet each other often enough. If thepopulation of Fairmen rises above 33%, then the tendency will be forthem to rise to fixation because their extra gains when they meet eachother compensates for their losses when they meet Greedies. You cansee this by noticing that when each strategy is used by 33% of thepopulation, all have an expected average payoff of 1/3. Therefore, anyrise above this threshold on the part of Fairmen will tend to pushthem towards fixation.</p> <p>This result shows that and how, given certain relatively generalconditions, justice as we have defined it <em>can</em> arisedynamically. The news for the fans of justice gets more cheerful stillif we introduce <em>correlated play</em>.</p> <p>The model we just considered assumes that strategies are not<em>correlated</em>, that is, that the probability with which everystrategy meets every other strategy is a simple function of theirrelative frequencies in the population. We now examine what happens inour dynamic resource-division game when we introduce correlation.Suppose that Fairmen have a slight ability to distinguish and seek outother Fairmen as interaction partners. In that case, Fairmen on averagedo better, and this must have the effect of lowering their thresholdfor going to fixation.</p> <p>An evolutionary game modeler studies the effects of correlation and otherparametric constraints by means of running large computer simulationsin which the strategies compete with one another, round after round, inthe virtual environment. The starting proportions of strategies, andany chosen degree of correlation, can simply be set in the programme.One can then watch its dynamics unfold over time, and measure theproportion of time it stays in any one equilibrium. These proportionsare represented by the relative sizes of the <em>basins ofattraction</em> for different possible equilibria. Equilibria areattractor points in a dynamic space; a basin of attraction for eachsuch point is then the set of points in the space from which thepopulation will converge to the equilibrium in question.</p> <p>In introducing correlation into his model, Skyrms first sets thedegree of correlation at a very small .1. This causes the basin ofattraction for equilibrium (i) to shrink by half. When the degree ofcorrelation is set to .2, the polymorphic basin reduces to the pointat which the population starts in the polymorphism. Thus very smallincreases in correlation produce large proportionate increases in thestability of the equilibrium where everyone plays Fairman. A smallamount of correlation is a reasonable assumption in most populations,given that neighbours tend to interact with one another and to mimicone another (either genetically or because of tendencies todeliberately copy each other), and because genetically and culturally similar animalsare more likely to live in common environments. Thus if justice canarise at all it will tend to be dominant and stable.</p> <p>Much of political philosophy consists in attempts to produce deductivenormative arguments intended to convince an unjust agent that she hasreasons to act justly. Skyrms's analysis suggests a quite differentapproach. Fairman will do best of all in the dynamic game if he takesactive steps to preserve correlation. Therefore, there is evolutionarypressure for both <em>moral approval of justice</em> and <em>justinstitutions</em> to arise. Most people may think that 50–50 splitsare ‘fair’, and worth maintaining by moral andinstitutional reward and sanction, <em>because</em> we are theproducts of a dynamic game that promoted our tendency to think thisway.</p> <p>The topic that has received most attention from evolutionary gametheorists is <em>altruism</em>, defined as any behaviour by anorganism that decreases its own expected fitness in a singleinteraction but increases that of the other interactor. It is commonin nature. How can it arise, however, given Darwinian competition?</p> <p>Skyrms studies this question using the dynamic Prisoner's Dilemma ashis example. This is simply a series of PD games played in apopulation, some of whose members are defectors and some of whom arecooperators. Payoffs, as always in dynamic games, are measured interms of expected numbers of copies of each strategy in futuregenerations.</p> <p>Let <strong>U</strong>(<em>A</em>) be the average fitness of strategy<em>A</em> in the population. Let <strong>U</strong> be the averagefitness of the whole population. Then the proportion of strategy<em>A</em> in the next generation is just the ratio<strong>U</strong>(<em>A</em>)/<strong>U</strong>. So if <em>A</em>has greater fitness than the population average <em>A</em>increases. If <em>A</em> has lower fitness than the population averagethen <em>A</em> decreases.</p> <p>In the dynamic PD where interaction is random (i.e., there's nocorrelation), defectors do better than the population average as longas there are cooperators around. This follows from the fact that, as wesaw in <a href="#PD">Section 2.4</a>, defection is always the dominantstrategy in a single game. 100% defection is therefore the ESS in thedynamic game without correlation, corresponding to the NE in theone-shot static PD.</p> <p>However, introducing the possibility of correlation radically changesthe picture. We now need to compute the average fitness of a strategy<em>given its probability of meeting each other possiblestrategy</em>. In the evolutionary PD, cooperators whose probability ofmeeting other cooperators is high do better than defectors whoseprobability of meeting other defectors is high. Correlation thusfavours cooperation.</p> <p>In order to be able to say something more precise about thisrelationship between correlation and cooperation (and in order to beable to relate evolutionary game theory to issues in decision theory,a matter falling outside the scope of this article), Skyrms introducesa new technical concept. He calls a strategy <em>adaptivelyratifiable</em> if there is a region around its fixation point in thedynamic space such that from anywhere within that region it will go tofixation. In the dynamic PD, both defection and cooperation areadaptively ratifiable. The relative sizes of basins of attraction arehighly sensitive to the particular mechanisms by which correlation isachieved. To illustrate this point, Skyrms builds severalexamples.</p> <p>One of Skyrms's models introduces correlation by means of a<em>filter</em> on pairing for interaction. Suppose that in round 1 ofa dynamic PD individuals inspect each other and interact, or not,depending on what they find. In the second and subsequent rounds, allindividuals who didn't pair in round 1 are randomly paired. In thisgame, the basin of attraction for defection is large <em>unless</em>there is a high proportion of cooperators in round one. In this case,defectors fail to pair in round 1, then get paired mostly with eachother in round 2 and drive each other to extinction. A model which ismore interesting, because its mechanism is less artificial, does notallow individuals to choose their partners, but requires them tointeract with those closest to them. Because of genetic relatedness(or cultural learning by copying) individuals are more likely toresemble their neighbours than not. If this (finite) population isarrayed along one dimension (i.e., along a line), and both cooperatorsand defectors are introduced into positions along it at random, thenwe get the following dynamics. Isolated cooperators have lowerexpected fitness than the surrounding defectors and are driven locallyto extinction. Members of groups of two cooperators have a 50%probability of interacting with each other, and a 50% probability ofeach interacting with a defector. As a result, their average expectedfitness remains smaller than that of their neighbouring defectors, andthey too face probable extinction. Groups of three cooperators form anunstable point from which both extinction and expansion are equallylikely. However, in groups of four or more cooperators at least oneencounter of a cooperator with a cooperator sufficient to at leastreplace the original group is guaranteed. Under this circumstance, thecooperators as a group do better than the surrounding defectors andincrease at their expense. Eventually cooperators go <em>almost</em>to fixation—but nor quite. Single defectors on the periphery ofthe population prey on the cooperators at the ends and survive aslittle ‘criminal communities’. We thus see that altruismcan not only be maintained by the dynamics of evolutionary games, but,with correlation, can even spread and colonize originallynon-altruistic populations.</p> <p>Darwinian dynamics thus offers qualified good news for cooperation.Notice, however, that this holds only so long as individuals are stuckwith their natural or cultural programming and can't re-evaluate theirutilities for themselves. If our agents get too smart and flexible,they may notice that they're in PDs and would each be best offdefecting. In that case, they'll eventually drive themselves toextinction — unless they develop stable, and effective, moralnorms that work to reinforce cooperation. But, of course, these arejust what we would expect to evolve in populations of animals whoseaverage fitness levels are closely linked to their capacities forsuccessful social cooperation. Even given this, these populations willgo extinct unless they care about future generations for somereason. But there's no rational reason as to why agents<em>should</em> care about future generations if each new generationwholly replaces the preceding one at each change of cohorts. For thisreason, economists use ‘overlapping generations’ modelswhen modeling distribution games. Individuals in generation 1 who willlast until generation 5 save resources for the generation 3individuals with whom they'll want to cooperate; and by generation 3the new individuals care about generation 6; and so on.</p> <p><a href="#Gin09">Gintis (2009)</a> argues that when we set out to useevolutionary game theory to unify the behavioral sciences, we begin byusing it to unify game theory itself. We have pointed out at severalearlier points in the present article that NE and SPE are problematicsolution concepts in many applications where explicit institutionalrules are missing because agents only have incentives to play NE orSPE to the extent that they are confident that other agents will dolikewise. To the extent that agents do not have such confidence— and this, by the way, is itself an insight due to game theory— what should be predicted is general disorder and socialconfusion. Gintis shows in detail how the key to this problem is theexistence of what he calls a ‘choreographer’. By thismeans some exogenous element that informs agents about whichequilibrium strategies they should expect others to play. As discussedin <a href="#Com">Section 5</a>, cultural norms are probably the mostimportant choreographers for people. Interesting utility functionsthat incorporate norms of the relevant sort are extensively studiedin <a href="#Bic06">Bicchieri (2006)</a>. In this context, Gintisdemonstrates a further unifying element of great importance: if agentsattach positive utility to following the choreographer's suggestions(that is, to being strategically correlated with others for the sheersake of it), then wherever competing potential payoffs do notoverwhelm this incentive, agents can also be expected to consistentlyestimate Bayesian priors, and thus arrive at equilibria-in-beliefs, asdiscussed in <a href="#Beliefs">Section 3.1</a>, in games of imperfectinformation.</p> <p>In light of this, when we wonder about the value of game-theoreticmodels in application to human behavior outside of well-structuredmarkets, much hinges on what we take to be plausible and empiricallyvalidated sources of people's incentives to be coordinated with oneanother. This has been a subject of extensive recent debate, which wewill review in <a href="#Human">Section 7.3</a> below.</p> <h2><a name="Behav">7. Game Theory and Behavioral Evidence</a></h2> <p>In earlier sections, we reviewed some problems that arise fromtreating classical (non-evolutionary) game theory as a normativetheory that tells people what they ought to do if they wish to berational in strategic situations. The difficulty, as we saw, is thatthere seems to be no one solution concept we can unequivocallyrecommend for all situations, particularly where agents have privateinformation. However, in the previous section we showed how appeal toevolutionary foundations sheds light on conditions under which utilityfunctions that have been explicitly worked out can plausibly beapplied to groups of people, leading to game-theoretic models withplausible and stable solutions. So far, however, we have not reviewedany actual empirical evidence from behavioral observations orexperiments. Has game theory indeed helped empirical researchers makenew discoveries about behavior (human or otherwise)? If so, what ingeneral has the content of these discoveries been?</p> <p>In addressing these questions, an immediate epistemological issueconfronts us. There is no way of applying game theory ‘all byitself’, independently of other modelling technologies. Usingterminology standard in the philosophy of science, one can test agame-theoretic model of a phenomenon only in tandem with‘auxiliary assumptions’ about the phenomenon inquestion. At least, this follows if one is strict about treating gametheory purely as mathematics, with no empirical content of its own. Inone sense, a theory with no empirical content is never open to testingat all; one can only worry about whether the axioms on which thetheory is based are mutually consistent. A mathematical theory cannevertheless be evaluated with respect to empirical<em>usefulness</em>. One kind of philosophical criticism that hassometimes been made of game theory, interpreted as a mathematical toolfor modelling behavioral phenomena, is that its application always orusually requires resort to false, misleading or badly simplisticassumptions about those phenomena. We would expect this criticism tohave different degrees of force in different contexts of application,as the auxiliary assumptions vary.</p> <p>So matters turn out. There is no interesting domain in whichapplications of game theory have been completelyuncontroversial. However, there has been generally easier consensus onhow to use game theory (both classical and evolutionary) to understandnon-human animal behavior than on how to deploy it for explanation andprediction of the strategic activities of people. Let us first brieflyconsider philosophical and methodological issues that have arisenaround application of game theory in non-human biology, beforedevoting fuller attention to game-theoretic social science.</p> <p>The least controversial game-theoretic modelling has applied theclassical form of the theory to consideration of strategies by whichnon-human animals seek to acquire the basic resource relevant to theirevolutionary tournament: opportunities to produce offspring that arethemselves likely to reproduce. In order to thereby maximize theirexpected fitness, animals must find optimal trade-offs among variousintermediate goods, such as nutrition, security from predation andability to out-compete rivals for mates. Efficient trade-off pointsamong these goods can often be estimated for particular species inparticular environmental circumstances, and, on the basis of theseestimations, both parametric and non-parametric equilibria can bederived. Models of this sort have an impressive track record inpredicting and explaining independent empirical data on such strategicphenomena as competitive foraging, mate selection, nepotism, siblingrivalry,herding, collective anti-predator vigilance and signaling,reciprocal grooming, and interspecific mutuality (symbiosis). (Forexamples see <a href="#Krebs84">Krebs and Davies 1984</a>, <a href="#Bell91">Bell 1991</a>, <a href="#Dug98">Dugatkin and Reeve 1998</a>, <a href="#Duk98">Dukas 1998</a>, and <a href="#Noe01">Noe, van Hoof and Hammerstein 2001</a>.) On the other hand, as <a href="#Ham03">Hammerstein (2003)</a>observes, reciprocity, and its exploitation and metaexploitation, aremuch more rarely seen in social non-human animals than game-theoreticmodeling would lead us to anticipate. One explanation for thissuggested by Hammerstein is that non-human animals typically have lessability to restrict their interaction partners than do people. Ourdiscussion in the previous section of the importance of correlationfor stabilizing game solutions lends theoretical support to thissuggestion.</p> <p>Why has classical game theory helped to predict non-human animalbehavior more straightforwardly than it has done most human behavior?The answer is presumed to lie in different levels of complication amongst therelationships between auxiliary assumptions and phenomena. <a href="#Ross05a">Ross (2005a)</a> offers the following account. Utility-maximization andfitness-maximization problems are the domain of economics. Economictheory identifies the maximizing units — economic agents — withunchanging preference fields. Identification of whole biologicalindividuals with such agents is more plausible the less cognitivelysophisticated the organism. Thus insects (for example) are tailor-madefor easy application of Revealed Preference Theory (see <a href="#Util">Section 2.1</a>). As nervous systems become more complex, however, we encounter animalsthat learn. Learning can cause a sufficient degree of permanentmodification in an animal's behavioral patterns that we can preservethe identification of the biological individual with a single agentacross the modification only at the cost of explanatory emptiness(because assignments of utility functions become increasingly adhoc). Furthermore, increasing complexity confounds simple modeling ona second dimension: cognitively sophisticated animals not only changetheir preferences over time, but are governed by distributed controlprocesses that make them sites of competition among <em>internal</em>agents (<a href="#Sch80">Schelling 1980</a>; <a href="#Ain92">Ainslie 1992</a>, <a href="#Ain01">Ainslie 2001</a>). Thus they are notstraightforward economic agents even <em>at</em> a time. In settingout to model the behavior of people using any part of economic theory,including game theory, we must recognize that the relationship betweenany given person and an economic agent we construct for modelingpurposes will always be more complicated than simple identity.</p> <p>There is of course no sudden crossing point at which an animalbecomes too cognitively sophisticated to be modeled as a single economic agent,and for all animals (including humans) there are contexts in which wecan usefully ignore the synchronic dimension of complexity. However,we encounter a phase shift in modeling dynamics when we turn fromasocial animals to non-eusocial social ones. (That is, animals thatare social but that don't, like ants, bees, wasps, termites and nakedmole rats, achieve cooperation thanks to fundamental changes in theirpopulation genetics that make individuals within groups into nearclones. Main known instances are parrots, corvids, bats, rats,canines, hyenas, pigs, weasels, elephants, hyraxes, cetacians, andprimates.) In their cases stabilization of internal control dynamicsis partly located <em>outside</em> the individuals, at the level ofgroup dynamics. With these creatures, modeling an individual as aneconomic agent, with a single comprehensive utility function, is a drasticidealization, which can only be done with the greatest methodologicalcaution and attention to specific contextual factors relevant to theparticular modeling exercise. Applications of game theory here canonly be empirically adequate to the extent that the economic modelingis empirically adequate.</p> <p><em>H. sapiens</em> is the extreme case inthis respect. Individual humans are socially controlled to a degreeunknown in any other non-eusocial species. At the same time, theirgreat cognitive plasticity allows them to vary significantly betweencultures. People are thus the least straightforward economic agentsamong all organisms. (It might thus be thought ironic that they weretaken, originally and for many years, to be the exemplary instances ofeconomic agency.) We will consider the implications of this forapplications of game theory below.</p> <p>First, however, comments are in order concerning the empiricaladequacy of <em>evolutionary</em> game theory to explain and predictdistributions of strategic dispositions in populations of agents. Suchmodeling is applied both to animals as products of natural selection(<a href="#Hof98">Hofbauer and Sigmund 1998</a>), and to non-eusocialsocial animals (but especially humans) as products of culturalselection (<a href="#Young98">Young 1998</a>). There are two mainkinds of auxiliary assumptions one must justify, relative to aparticular instance at hand, in constructing such applications. First,one must have grounds for confidence that the dispositions one seeksto explain are (either biological or cultural, as the case maybe) <em>adaptations</em> — that is, dispositions that wereselected and are maintained because of the way in which they promotetheir own fitness or the fitness of the wider system, rather thanbeing accidents or structurally inevitable byproducts of otheradaptations. (See <a href="#Den95">Dennett 1995</a> for a generaldiscussion of this issue.) Second, one must be able to set themodeling enterprise in the context of a justified set of assumptionsabout interrelationships among nested evolutionary processes ondifferent time scales. (For example, in the case of a species withcultural dynamics, how does slow genetic evolution constrain fastcultural evolution? How does cultural evolution feed back into geneticevolution, if it feeds back at all? For a supremely lucid discussionof these issues, see <a href="#Ste03">Sterelny 2003</a>.) Conflictingviews over which such assumptions should be made about human evolutionare the basis for lively current disputes in the evolutionarygame-theoretic modeling of human behavioral dispositions andinstitutions. This is where issues in evolutionary game theory meetissues in the booming field of <em>behavioral-experimental</em> gametheory. I will therefore first describe the second field beforeclosing the present article by giving a sense of the controversiesjust alluded to, which now constitute the liveliest domain ofphilosophical argument in the foundations of game theory and itsapplications.</p> <h3><a name="Lab">7.1 Game Theory in the Laboratory</a></h3> <p> Economists have been testing theories by running laboratoryexperiments with human and other animal subjects since pioneering workby <a href="#Thu31">Thurstone (1931)</a>. In recent decades, the volume of such work has become positivelygigantic. The vast majority of it sets subjects in microeconomicproblem environments that are imperfectly competitive. Since this isprecisely the condition in which microeconomics collapses into gametheory, most experimental economics has been experimental gametheory. It is thus difficult to distinguish between experimentallymotivated questions about the empirical adequacy of microeconomictheory and questions about the empirical adequacy of game theory.</p> <p>We can here give only a broad overview of an enormous and complicatedliterature. Readers are referred to outstanding surveys in <a href="#Kag95">Kagel and Roth (1995)</a>, <a href="#Cam03">Camerer (2003)</a>, <a href="#Sam05">Samuelson (2005)</a>, and <a href="#Gua05">Guala (2005)</a>. A useful high-level principle for sorting the literature indexes itto the different auxiliary assumptions with which game-theoreticaxioms are applied. It is often said in popular presentations (e.g., <a href="#Orm94">Ormerod 1994</a>) that the experimental data generally refute the hypothesis thatpeople are rational economic agents. Such claims are too imprecise tobe sustainable interpretations of the results. All data are consistentwith the view that people are <em>approximate</em> economic agents, atleast for stretches of time long enough to permit game-theoreticanalysis of particular scenarios, in the minimal sense that theirbehavior can be modeled compatibly with Revealed Preference Theory (see <a href="#Util">Section 2.1</a>). However, RPT makes so little in the way of empirical demands thatthis is not nearly as surprising as many non-economists suppose (<a href="#Ross05a">Ross (2005a)</a>. What is really at issue in many of the debates around the generalinterpretation of experimental evidence is the extent to which peopleare maximizers of expected utility. As we saw in <a href="#Uncer">Section 3</a>, expected utility theory (EUT) is generally applied in tandem withgame theory in order to model situations involving uncertainty —which is to say, most situations of interest in behavioralscience. However, a variety of alternative mathematical accounts ofmaximization lend themselves to Von Neumann-Morgensterncardinalization of utility; and the empirical adequacy of game theorywould be called into question only if we thought that people'sbehavior is not generally describable by means of cardinal VNMufs on asuitably liberal interpretation of these (i.e., as opposed to a narrowinterpretation in which VNM utility is defined strictly in terms ofEUT).</p> <p>What the experimental literature truly appears to show is a world ofbehavior that is very ‘messy’ from the theorist's point ofview. The messiness in question arises from enormous heterogeneity,both among people and among (person, situation) vectors. There is nosingle family of optimization functions such that people act so as tomaximize a member of that family in all circumstances. Faced withwell-learned problems in contexts that are not unduly demanding, orthat are highly institutionally structured people often behave likeexpected utility maximizers. For general reviews of theoretical issuesand evidence, see <a href="#Smi08">Smith (2008)</a>and <a href="#Bin07">Binmore (2007)</a>. For an extended sequence ofexamples of empirical studies, see the so-called ‘continuousdouble auction’ experiments discussed in <a href="#Plott78">Plott and Smith 1978</a> and Smith <a href="#Smi62">1962</a>, <a href="#Smi64">1964</a>, <a href="#Smi65">1965</a>, <a href="#Smi76">1976</a>, <a href="#Smi82">1982</a>. As a result, classical game theory can be used in such domains withhigh reliability to predict behavior and implement public policy, asis demonstrated by the dozens of extremely successful governmentauctions of utilities and other assets designed by game theorists toincrease public revenue (<a href="#Bin02">Binmore and Klemperer 2002</a>).</p> <p>In other contexts, interpreting people's behavior as expected-utilitymaximizing requires undue violence to the principle of parsimony intheory construction. We get better prediction using fewer assumptionsif we suppose that subjects are maximizing according to one of severalalternatives (which will not be described here because they are notdirectly about game theory): a version of prospect theory (<a href="#Kah79">Kahneman and Tversky 1979)</a>, or alpha-nu utility theory (<a href="#Chew79">Chew and MacCrimmon 1979)</a>, or expected utility theory with rank-dependent probabilities (<a href="#Qui82">Quiggin 1982</a>, <a href="#Yaa87">Yaari 1987)</a>. In general, in testing the empirical usefulness (for studying humans)of game theory in conjunction with some theory of the target ofmaximization, it is more often the latter than the former that isadjusted to special cases.</p> <p>A more serious threat to the usefulness of game theory is evidence ofsystematic reversal of preferences, in both humans and otheranimals. This is more serious both because it extends beyond the humancase, and because it challenges Revealed Preference Theory (RPT)rather than just EUT. As explained in <a href="#Util">Section 2.1</a>, RPT, unlike EUT, is among the axiomatic foundations of game theoryinterpreted non-psychologically. (Not all writers agree that apparentpreference reversal phenomena threaten RPT rather than EUT; but seethe discussions in <a href="#Cam95">Camerer (1995)</a>, pp. 660–665, and <a href="#Ross05a">Ross (2005a)</a>, pp. 177–181.) A basis for preference reversals that seems to be common inanimals with brains is <em>hyperbolic discounting of the future</em> (<a href="#Str56">Strotz 1956</a>, <a href="#Ain92">Ainslie 1992</a>). This is the phenomenon whereby agents discount future rewards moresteeply in close temporal distances from the current reference pointthan at more remote temporal distances. This is best understood bycontrast with the idea found in most traditional economic modelsof <em>exponential</em> discounting, in which there is a linearrelationship between the rate of change in the distance to a payoffand the rate at which the value of the payoff from the reference pointdeclines. The figure below shows exponential and hyperbolic curves forthe same interval from a reference point to a future payoff. Thebottom one graphs the hyperbolic function; the bowed shape resultsfrom the change in the rate of discounting.</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure15.jpg" alt="Figure 15" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 15</strong> </blockquote> <p>A result of this is that, as later prospects come closer to the pointof possible consumption, people and other animals will sometimes spendresources undoing the consequences of previous actions that also costthem resources. For example: deciding today whether to mark a pile ofundergraduate essays or watch a baseball game, I procrastinate,despite knowing that by doing so I put out of reach some even more funpossibility that might come up for tomorrow (when there's an equallyattractive ball game on if the better option doesn't arise). So far,this is consistent with rational preference: if the world might endtonight, with a tiny but nonzero probability, then there's some levelof risk aversion at which I'd rather leave the essays unmarked. Thefigure below compares two exponential discount curves, the lower onefor the value of the game I watch before finishing my marking, and thehigher one for the more valuable game I enjoy after completing thejob. Both have higher value from the reference point the closer theyare to it; but the curves do not cross, so my revealed preferences areconsistent over time no matter how impatient I might be.</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure16.jpg" alt="Figure 16" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 16</strong> </blockquote> <p> However, if I bind myself against procrastination by buying a ticketfor tomorrow's game, when in the absence of the awful task I wouldn'thave done so, then I've violated intertemporal preferenceconsistency. More vividly, had I been in a position to choose lastweek whether to procrastinate today, I'd have chosen not to. In thiscase, my discount curve drawn from the reference point of last weekcrosses the curve drawn from the perspective of today, and mypreferences reverse. The figure below shows this situation.</p> <blockquote> <img src="figure17.jpg" alt="Figure 17" /> <br /> <strong>Figure 17</strong> </blockquote> <p>This phenomenon complicates applications of classical game theory tointelligent animals. However, it clearly doesn't vitiate italtogether, since people (and other animals) often <em>don't</em>reverse their preferences. (If this weren't true, the successfulauction models and other s-called ‘mechanism designs’ would bemysterious.) Interestingly, the leading theories that aim to explainwhy hyperbolic discounters often behave in accordance with RPTthemselves appeal to game theoretic principles. <a href="#Ain92">Ainslie (1992</a>, <a href="#Ain01">2001)</a> has produced an account of people as communities of internalbargaining interests, in which subunits based on short-term,medium-term and long-term interests face conflict that they mustresolve because if they don't, and instead generate an internalHobbesian breakdown (<a href="#Mot">Section 1</a>), outside agents who avoid the Hobbesian outcome can ruin themall. The device of the Hobbesian tyrant is unavailable to thebrain. Therefore, its behavior (when system-level insanity is avoided)is a sequence of self-enforcing equilibria of the sort studied bygame-theoretic public choice literature on coalitional bargaining indemocratic legislatures. That is, the internal politics of the brainconsists in ‘logrolling’ (<a href="#Strat97">Stratmann 1997</a>). These internal dynamics are then partly regulated and stabilized bythe wider social games in which coalitions (people as wholes overtemporal subparts of their biographies) are embedded (<a href="#Ross05a">Ross 2005a </a>, pp. 334–353). (For example: social expectations about someone's roleas a salesperson set behavioral equilibrium targets for the logrollingprocesses in their brain.) This potentially adds further relevantelements to the explanation of why and how stable institutions withrelatively transparent rules are key conditions that help people moreclosely resemble straightforward economic agents, such that classicalgame theory finds reliable application to them as entire units.</p> <p>One important note of caution is in order for the reader here. Much ofthe recent behavioral literature takes for granted that temporallyinconsistent discounting is the standard or default case forpeople. However, <a href="#And08">Andersen <em>et al</em> (2008)</a>show empirically that this arises from (i) assuming that groups ofpeople are homogenous with respect to which functional forms bestdescribe their discounting behavior, and (ii) failure to independentlyelicit and control for people's differing levels of risk aversion inestimating their discount functions. In a range of populations thathave been studied with these two considerations in mind, data suggestthat temporally consistent discounting describes substantially higherproportions of choices than does temporally inconsistentchoices. Over-generalization of hyperbolic discounting models shouldthus be avoided. </p> <h3><a name="Neuro">7.2 Neuroeconomics and Game Theory</a></h3> <p>The idea that game theory can find novel application to the internaldynamics of brains, as suggested in the previous section, has beendeveloped from independent motivations by the new research programknown as <em>neuroeconomics</em> (<a href="#Mon02">Montague and Berns 2002</a>, <a href="#Gli03">Glimcher 2003</a>, <a href="#Ross05a">Ross 2005a</a>, pp. 320–334, <a href="#Cam05">Camerer, Loewenstein and Prelec 2005</a>). Thanks to new non-invasive scanning technologies, especiallyfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), it has recently becomepossible to study synaptic activity in working brains while theyrespond to controlled cues. This has allowed direct monitoring accessto the brain's computation of expected values of rewards, which are(naturally) taken to play a crucial role in determiningbehavior. Economic theory is used to frame the derivation of thefunctions maximized by synaptic-level computation of these expectedvalues; hence the name ‘neuroeconomics’.</p> <p>Game theory plays a leading role in neuroeconomics at twolevels. First, game theory has been used to predict the computationsthat individual neurons and groups of neurons serving the rewardsystem must perform. In the best publicized example, <a href="#Gli03">Glimcher (2003)</a> and colleagues have fMRI-scanned monkeys they had trained to playso-called ‘inspection games’ against computers. In aninspection game, one player faces a series of choices either to workfor a reward, in which case he is sure to receive it, or to performanother, easier action (“shirking”), in which case he will receive thereward only if the other player (the “inspector”) is not monitoringhim. Assume that the first player's (the “worker's”) behavior revealsa utility function bounded on each end as follows: he will work onevery occasion if the inspector always monitors and he will shirk onevery occasion if the inspector never monitors. The inspector prefersto obtain the highest possible amount of work for the lowest possiblemonitoring rate. In this game, the only NE for bothplayers are in mixed strategies, since any pattern in one player'sstrategy that can be detected by the other can be exploited. For anygiven pair of specific utility functions for the two players meetingthe constraints described above, any pair of strategies in which, oneach trial, either the worker is indifferent between working andshirking or the inspector is indifferent between monitoring and notmonitoring, is a NE.</p> <p>Applying inspection game analyses to pairs or groups of agentsrequires us to have <em>either</em> independently justified theirutility functions over all variables relevant to their play, in whichcase we can define NE and then test to see whether they successfullymaximize expected utility; <em>or</em> to assume that they maximizeexpected utility, or obey some other rule such as a matching function,and then infer their utility functions from their behavior. Eithersuch procedure can be sensible in different empirical contexts. Butepistemological leverage increases greatly if the utility function ofthe inspector is exogenously determined, as it often is. (Policeimplementing random roadside inspections to catch drunk drivers, forexample, typically have a maximum incidence of drunk driving assignedto them as a target by policy, and an exogenously set budget. Thesedetermine their utility function, given a distribution of preferencesand attitudes to risk among the population of drivers.) In the case ofGlimcher's experiments the inspector is a computer, so its program isunder experimental control and its side of the payoff matrix isknown. Proxies for the subjects' expected utility, in this casesquirts of fruit juice for the monkeys, can be antecedently determinedin parametric test settings. The computer is then programmed with theeconomic model of the monkeys, and can search the data in theirbehavior in game conditions for exploitable patterns, varying itsstrategy accordingly. With these variables fixed,expected-utility-maximizing NE behavior by the monkeys can becalculated and tested by manipulating the computer's utility functionin various runs of the game.</p> <p>Monkey behavior after training tracks NE very robustly (as does thebehavior of people playing similar games for monetary prizes; <a href="#Gli03">Glimcher 2003</a>, pp. 307–308). Working with trained monkeys, Glimcher and colleaguescould then perform the experiments of significance here. Working andshirking behaviors for the monkeys had been associated by theirtraining with staring either to the right or to the left on a visualdisplay. In earlier experiments, <a href="#Pla99">Platt and Glimcher (1999)</a> had established that, in parametric settings, as juice rewards variedfrom one block of trials to another, firing rates of each parietalneuron that controls eye movements could be trained to encode theexpected utility to the monkey of each possible movement relative tothe expected utility of the alternative movement. Thus “movements thatwere worth 0.4 ml of juice were represented twice as strongly [inneural firing probabilities] as movements worth 0.2 ml of juice”(p. 314). Unsurprisingly, when amounts of juice rewarded for eachmovement were varied from one block of trials to another, firing ratesalso varied.</p> <p>Against this background, Glimcher and colleagues could investigate theway in which monkeys' brains implemented the tracking of NE. When themonkeys played the inspection game against the computer, the targetassociated with shirking could be set at the optimal location, giventhe prior training, for a specific neuron under study, while the worktarget would appear at a null location. This permitted Glimcher totest the answer to the following question: did the monkeys maintain NEin the game by keeping the firing rate of the neuron constant whilethe actual and optimal behavior of the monkey as a whole varied? Thedata robustly gave the answer ‘yes’. Glimcher reasonablyinterprets these data as suggesting that neural firing rates, at leastin this cortical region for this task, encode expected utility in bothparametric and nonparametric settings. Here we have an apparentvindication of the empirical applicability of classical game theory ina context independent of institutions or social conventions.</p> <p>Further analysis pushed the hypothesis deeper. The computer playingInspector was presented with the same sequence of outcomes as itsmonkey opponent had received on the previous day's play, and for eachmove was asked to assess the relative expected values of the shirkingand working actions available on the next move. Glimcher reports apositive correlation between small fluctuations around the stable NEfiring rates in the individual neuron and the expected valuesestimated by the computer trying to track the same NE. Glimchercomments on this finding as follows:</p> <blockquote> The neurons seemed to be reflecting, on a play-by-play basis, acomputation close to the one performed by our computer … [A]t a… [relatively] … microscopic scale, we were able to usegame theory to begin to describe the decision-by-decision computationsthat the neurons in area LIP were performing. ( <a href="#Gli03">Glimcher 2003</a>, p. 317) </blockquote> <p>Thus we find game theory reaching beyond its traditional role as atechnology for framing high-level constraints on evolutionary dynamicsor on behavior by well-informed agents operating in institutionalstraightjackets. In Glimcher's hands, it is used to directly modelactivity in a monkey's brain. <a href="#Ross05a">Ross (2005a)</a>argues that groups of neurons thus modeled should not be identifiedwith the sub-personal game-playing units found in Ainslie's theory ofintra-personal bargaining described earlier; that would involve a kindof straightforward reduction that experience in the behavioral andlife science has taught us not to expect. This issue has since arisenin a direct dispute between neuroeconomists over rival interpretationsof fMRI observations of intertemporal choice and discounting(<a href="#McC04">McClure <em>et al</em>.2004)</a>, <a href="#Gli07">Glimcher <em>et al</em>. 2007</a>). Theweight of evidence so far favors the view that if it is sometimesuseful to analyze people's choices as equilibria in games amongstsub-personal agents, the sub-personal agents in question should not beidentified with separate brain areas. The opposite interpretation isunfortunately still most common in less specialized literature. </p> <p>We have now seen the first level at which neuroeconomics applies gametheory. A second level arises thanks to new research methodologydeveloped by Read Montague's team centered at Baylor College ofMedicine. As described earlier in this section, the majority of workin experimental/behavioral economics has involved studying subjectswhile they play games. Initial technical constraints imposed by thefMRI technology prevented analysts from being able to compareinter-personal brain data when subjects are asked to replicate thesegames under neuroimaging. The problem is that the brain doesn'tnecessarily (or even typically) perform the same task using exactlythe same neural resources from one occasion to the next in a singlebrain, let alone from one brain to another. One thus cannot simplyaggregate independent observations under generalizations that linktypes of behavior and their neural signatures. That is, one cannotfirst scan a subject playing one strategic position in a game, thenscan a person in the next strategic position in a repetition of thegame, and so on iteratively, all with a view to assembling a post hocpicture of the brains in interaction. Rather, the interaction itselfmust be directly scanned if one wants an aggregated neural image of agame. However, only one person at a time fits without extremediscomfort into a scanning capsule. Montague and colleagues haveaddressed this problem by developing what they call‘hyperscanning’ software that allows two computers linkedto separate scanners to jointly calibrate the data. Since thecomputers need only be virtually linked, this allows researchers torun experimental games with geographically separated subjects underscanning. Thirty years worth of results in experimental game theorythus stand waiting for re-interpretation under the discipline of apowerful new dimension of empirical measurement. Where formerly wecould only conjecture up to the limits of behavioral discriminationwhich strategies agents implemented under various game conditions, wenow look forward to the prospect of literally watching strategiccomputations as they are carried out.</p> <p>An early instance of this kind of work is <a href="#Kin05">King-Casas <em>et al</em>. (2005)</a>. They took a standard protocol from behavioral game theory, theso-called ‘trust’ game, and implemented it with subjectsunder hyper-scanning. This game involves two players. In its repeatedformat as used in the King-Casas <em>et al</em>. experiment, the firstplayer is designated the ‘investor’ and the second the‘trustee’. The investor begins with $20, of which she cankeep any portion of her choice while investing the remainder with thetrustee. In the trustee's hands the invested amount is tripled by theexperimenter. The trustee may then return as much or as little of thisprofit to the investor as he deems fit. The procedure is run for tenrounds, with players' identities kept anonymous from one another.</p> <p>This game has an infinite number of NE. Previous data from behavioraleconomics are consistent with the claim that the modal NE in humanplay <em>approximates</em> both players using‘Tit-for-tat’ strategies (see <a href="#Repeat">Section 4</a>) modified by occasional defections to probe for information, and somepost-defection cooperation that manifests (limited) toleration of suchprobes. This is a very weak result, since it is compatible with a widerange of hypotheses on exactly which variations of Tit-for-tat areused and sustained, and thus licenses no inferences about potentialdynamics under different learning conditions, institutions, orcross-cultural transfers.</p> <p>When they ran this game under hyperscanning, the King-Casas andMontague group obtained the following results. Neurons in thetrustee's caudate nucleus (generally thought to implement computationsor outputs of midbrain dopaminergic systems) showed strong responsewhen investors benevolently reciprocated trust — that is,responded to defection with increased generosity. As the gameprogressed, these responses shifted from being reactionary to beinganticipatory. Thus reputational profiles as predicted by classicalgame-theoretic models were observed being constructed directly by thebrain. A further aspect of play not predictable by theoreticalmodeling alone, and which purely behavioral observation had not beensufficient to discriminate, is that responses by the caudate neuronsto malevolent reciprocity — reduced generosity in response tocooperation — were significantly smaller in amplitude. This maybe the mechanism by which the brain implements modification ofTit-for-tat so as to prevent occasional defections for informationalprobing from unravelling cooperation permanently. The fact that thesedifferences in response levels can be quantitatively measured suggestthat, once more data from variations (including cross-culturalvariations) on the experiment are in hand, we may come to know indetail which strategies people are disposed use in trust games underdifferent conditions. As noted previously, purely behavioral evidenceunderdetermines this knowledge, merely ruling out strategiesinconsistent with observed equilibria. </p> <p>The advance in understanding promised by this sortof investigation mainly consists not in what it tells us aboutparticular types of games, but rather in comparative inferences itfacilitates about the ways in which contextual framing influencespeople's conjectures about which games they're playing. fMRI probesenable us to quantitatively estimate degrees of strategic<em>surprise</em>. This is a highly portentous new source of leveragefor the empirical application of game theory. Note that reciprocallyinteracting expectations about surprise may themselves be subject tostrategic manipulation, but this is an idea that has barely begun tobe theoretically explored by game theorists (see <a href="#Ross04">Ross and Dumouchel 2004</a>). That we now have the prospect of empirically testing such newtheories, as opposed to just hypothetically modeling them, shouldstimulate their development.</p> <h3><a name="Human">7.3 Game Theoretic Models of Human Nature</a></h3> <p>The developments reviewed in the previous section bring us up to themoving frontier of experimental / behavioral applications of classicalgame theory. We can now return to the branch point left off severalparagraphs back, where this stream of investigation meets that comingfrom evolutionary game theory. There is no serious doubt that, bycomparison to other non-eusocial animals —including our nearestrelatives, chimpanzees and bonobos — humans achieve prodigiousfeats of coordination (see <a href="#Repeat">Section 4</a>) (<a href="#Tom04">Tomasello <em>et al</em>. 2004</a>). A lively controversy, with important philosophical implications andfought on both sides with game-theoretic arguments, currently ragesover the question of whether this capacity can be wholly explained bycultural adaptation, or is better explained by inference to a geneticchange early in the career of <em>H. sapiens</em>.</p> <p> Henrich <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#Hen04">2004</a>, <a href="#Hen05">2005</a>) have run a series of experimental games with populations drawn fromfifteen small-scale human societies in South America, Africa, andAsia, including three groups of foragers, six groups of slash-and-burnhorticulturists, four groups of nomadic herders, and two groups ofsmall-scale agriculturists. The games (Ultimatum, Dictator, PublicGoods) they implemented all place subjects in situations broadlyresembling that of the Trust game discussed in the previoussection. That is, Ultimatum and Public Goods games are scenarios inwhich social welfare can be maximized, and each individual's welfaremaximized (Pareto efficiency achieved) if and only if at least someplayers use strategies that are not sub-game perfect equilibriumstrategies (see <a href="#Subgame">Section 2.6</a>). In Dictator games, a narrowly selfish first mover would capture allavailable profits. Thus in each of the three game types, SPE playerswho cared only about their own monetary welfare would get outcomesthat would involve highly inegalitarian payoffs. In none of thesocieties studied by Henrich <em>et al</em>. (or any other society inwhich games of this sort have been run) are such outcomesobserved. The players whose roles are such that they would take awayall but epsilon of the monetary profits if they and their partnersplayed SPE always offered the partners substantially more thanepsilon, and even then partners sometimes refused such offers at thecost of receiving no money. Furthermore, unlike the traditionalsubjects of experimental economics — university students inindustrialized countries — Henrich <em>et al</em>.'s subjectsdid not even play <em>Nash</em> equilibrium strategies with respect tomonetary payoffs. (That is, strategically advantaged players offeredlarger profit splits to strategically disadvantaged ones than wasnecessary to induce agreement to their offers.) Henrich <em>etal</em>. interpret these results by suggesting that all actual people,unlike ‘rational economic man’, value egalitarian outcomesto some extent. However, their experiments also show that this extentvaries significantly with culture, and is correlated with variationsin two specific cultural variables: typical payoffs to cooperation(the extent to which economic life in the society depends oncooperation with non-immediate kin) and aggregate market integration(a construct built out of independently measured degrees of socialcomplexity, anonymity, privacy, and settlement size). As the values ofthese two variables increase, game behavior shifts (weakly) in thedirection of Nash equilibrium play. Thus the researchers conclude thatpeople are genetically endowed with preferences for egalitarianism,but that the relative weight of these preferences is programmable bysocial learning processes conditioned on local cultural cues.</p> <p>In evaluating Henrich <em>et al</em>.'s interpretation of these data, weshould first note that the axioms defining ‘rational economicman’, which are incorporated into game theory in the waydiscussed in <a href="#Utility">Section 2.1</a>, do not include the property of selfishness. (See <a href="#Ross05a">Ross (2005a)</a> ch. 4; <a href="#Bin05b">Binmore (2005b)</a> and <a href="#Bin09">(2009)</a>; and any economics or game theory text that lets the mathematics dothe talking and doesn't insist on ‘spinning’ it in oneidealogical direction or another.) Orthodox game theory thus does notpredict that people will play SPE or NE strategies derived by treatingmonetary payoffs as equivalent to utility. <a href="#Bin05">Binmore (2005b)</a> is therefore justified in taking Henrich <em>et al</em>. to task overtheir fashionable rhetoric suggesting that their empirical workembarrasses orthodox theory. It does not.</p> <p>This is not to suggest that the anthropological interpretation of theempirical results should be taken as uncontroversial. Binmore (<a href="#Bin94">1994</a>, <a href="#Bin98">1998</a>, <a href="#Bin05a">2005a</a>, <a href="#Bin05b">2005b</a>) has argued for many years, based on a wide range of behavioral data,that when people play games with non-relatives they tend to learn toplay Nash equilibrium with respect to utility functions thatapproximately correspond to income functions. As he points out in <a href="#Bin05b">Binmore (2005b)</a>, Henrich <em>et al</em>.'s data do not test this hypothesis for theirsmall-scale societies, because their subjects were not exposed to thetest games for the (quite long, in the case of the Ultimatum game)learning period that theoretical and computational models suggest arerequired for people to converge on NE. When people play unfamiliargames, they tend to model them by reference to games they are used toin everyday experience. In particular, they tend to play one-shotlaboratory games as though they were familiar <em>repeated</em> games,since one-shot games are rare in normal social life outside of specialinstitutional contexts. Many of the interpretive remarks made byHenrich <em>et al</em>. are consistent with this hypothesis concerningtheir subjects, though they nevertheless explicitly reject the hypothesisitself. What is controversial here — the issues of spin around‘orthodox' theory aside — is less about what theparticular subjects in this experiment were doing than about whattheir behavior should lead us to infer about human evolution.</p> <p><a href="#Gin04">Gintis (2004)</a>, <a href="#Gin09">(2009)</a> arguesthat data of the sort we have been discussing support the followingconjecture about human evolution. Our ancestors were pure maximizersof individual fitness. Somewhere along the evolutionary line theseancestors arrived in circumstances where enough of them maximizedtheir individual fitness by maximizing that of their group(<a href="#Sob98">Sober and Wilson 1998</a>) that a geneticmodification went to fixation in the species: we developed preferencesnot just over our own individual welfare, but over the relativewelfare of all members of our communities, indexed to socialnorms <em>programmable</em> in each individual by culturallearning. Thus the contemporary researcher applying game theory tomodel a social situation is advised to unearth her subjects' utilityfunctions by (i) finding out what community (or communities) they aremembers of, and then (ii) inferring the utility function(s) programmedinto members of that community (communities) by studyingrepresentatives of each relevant community in a range of games andassuming that the outcomes are coordinated equilibria. Since theutility functions are the dependent variables here, the games must beindependently determined. We can typically hold at least the strategicforms of the relevant games fixed, Gintis supposes, by virtue of (a)our confidence that people prefer egalitarian outcomes, all else beingequal, to inegalitarian ones within the culturally evolved‘insider groups’ to which they perceive themselves asbelonging and (b) a requirement that game equilibria are drawn fromstable attractors in plausible evolutionary game-theoretic models ofthe culture's historical dynamics.</p> <p>Requirement (b) as a constraint on game-theoretic modeling of generalhuman strategic dispositions is no longer very controversial —or, at least, is no more controversial than the generic adaptationismin evolutionary anthropology of which it is one expression. However,some commentators are skeptical of Gintis's suggestion that there wasa genetic discontinuity in the evolution of human sociality. (For acognitive-evolutionary anthropology that explicitly denies suchdiscontinuity, see <a href="#Ste03">Sterelny 2003</a>.) Based partly on such skepticism (but more directly on behavioraldata) Binmore (<a href="#Bin05a">2005a</a>, <a href="#Bin05b">2005b</a>) resists modeling people as having built-in preferences foregalitarianism. According to Binmore's (<a href="#Bin94">1994</a>, <a href="#Bin98">1998</a>, <a href="#Bin05a">2005a</a>) model,the basic class of strategic problems facing non-eusocialsocial animals are coordination games. Human communities evolvecultural norms to select equilibria in these games, and many of theseequilibria will be compatible with high levels of apparentlyaltruistic behavior in some (but not all) games. Binmore argues thatpeople adapt their conceptions of fairness to whatever happen to betheir locally prevailing equilibrium selection rules. However, hemaintains that the <em>dynamic</em> development of such norms must becompatible, in the long run, with bargaining equilibria amongself-regarding individuals. Indeed, he argues that as societies evolveinstitutions that encourage what Henrich <em>et al</em>. callaggregate market integration (discussed above), their utilityfunctions and social norms tend to converge on self-regarding economicrationality with respect to welfare. This does not mean that Binmoreis pessimistic about the prospects for egalitarianism: he develops amodel showing that societies of rational bargainers can be pullednaturally along dynamically stable equilibrium paths towards norms ofdistribution corresponding to Rawlsian justice (<a href="#Raw71">Rawls 1971</a>). The principal barriers to such evolution, according to Binmore, areprecisely the kinds of other-regarding preferences that conservativesvalorize as a way of discouraging examination of more egalitarianbargaining equilibria that are within reach along societies'equilibrium paths.</p> <p>Resolution of this debate between Gintis and Binmore fortunately neednot wait upon discoveries about the deep human evolutionary past thatwe may never have. The models make rival empirical predictions of sometestable phenomena. If Gintis is right then there are limits, imposedby the discontinuity in hominid evolution, on the extent to whichpeople can learn to be self-regarding. This is the main significanceof the controversy discussed above over Henrich <em>et al</em>.'sinterpretation of their field data. Binmore's model of socialequilibrium selection also depends, unlike Gintis's, on widespreaddispositions among people to inflict second-order punishment onmembers of society who fail to sanction violators of social norms. <a href="#Gin05">Gintis (2005)</a> shows using a game theory model that this is implausible ifpunishment costs are significant. However, <a href="#Ross05b">Ross (2005b)</a> argues that the widespread assumption in the literature thatpunishment of norm-violation must be costly results from failure toadequately distinguish between models of the original evolution ofsociality, on the one hand, and models of the maintenance anddevelopment of norms and institutions once an initial set of them hasstabilized. Finally, Ross also points out that Binmore's objectivesare as much normative as descriptive: he aims to show egalitarians howto diagnose the errors in conservative rationalisations of the statusquo without calling for revolutions that put equilibrium pathstability (and, therefore, social welfare) at risk. It is a soundprinciple in constructing reform proposals that they should be‘knave-proof’ (as Hume put it), that is, should becompatible with less altruism than <em>might</em> prevail inpeople. Thus, despite the fact that the majority of researchersworking on game-theoretic foundations of social organization presentlyappear to side with Gintis and the other members of the Henrich <em>etal</em>. team, Binmore's alternative model has some strongconsiderations in its favor. Here, then, is another issue along thefrontier of game theory application awaiting resolution in the yearsto come.</p> <p> An enormous range of further applications of both classical andevolutionary game theory have been developed, but we have hopefullynow provided enough to convince the reader of the tremendous, andconstantly expanding, utility of this analytical tool.

I would also like to thank Sam Lazell for not only catching anasty patch of erroneous analysis in the second version, but going tothe superogatory trouble of actually providing fully correctedreasoning. If there were many such readers, all authors in thisproject would become increasingly collective over time. One of my MBAstudents, Anthony Boting, noticed that my solution to an example Iused in the second version rested on equivocating betweenrelative-frequency and objective-chance interpretations ofprobability. Two readers, Brian Ballsun-Stanton and George Mucalov,spotted this too and were kind enough to write to me about it. Manythanks to them. Joel Guttman pointed out that I'd illustrated a fewprinciples with some historical anecdotes that circulate in the gametheory community, but told them in a way that was too credulous withrespect to their accuracy. Michel Benaim and Mathius Grasselli notedthat I'd identified the wrong Plato text as the source of Socrates'sreflections on soldiers' incentives. Ken Binmore picked up anotherfactual error while the third revision was in preparation, as a resultof which no one else ever saw it. Not so for a mistake found by BobGalesloot that survived in the article all the way into the thirdedition. (That error was corrected in July 2010.) Some other readershelpfully spotted typos: thanks to Fabian Ottjes, Brad Colbourne,Nicholas Dozet and Gustavo Narez. Nelleke Bak, my in-house graphicsguru (and spouse) drew all figures except 15, 16, and 17, which weregenerously contributed by George Ainslie. My thanks to her andhim. Finally, thanks go to Colin Allen for technical support (in theeffort to deal with bandwidth problems to South Africa) prior topublication of the second version of this entry, and to DanielMcKenzie for procedural advice on preparation of the thirdversion.</p> </div> <!-- #aueditable --> <!--DO NOT MODIFY THIS LINE AND BELOW--> <div id="foot"> <span style="font-size: 11pt;"> <a href="../../info.html#c">Copyright &copy; 2010</a> by</span> <br /> <a href="http://uct.academia.edu/DonRoss" target="other">Don Ross</a>&lt; <a href="mailto:don%2eross%40uct%2eac%2eza"><em>don<abbr title=" dot ">.</abbr>ross<abbr title=" at ">@</abbr>uct<abbr title=" dot ">.</abbr>ac<abbr title=" dot ">.</abbr>za</em></a>&gt; </div> <!-- end #foot --> </div> <!-- end #content --> </body> </html>

Your body can adjust to these altitudes, but only if given enough time. Being in a hurry in the mountains of Nepal can be deadly! It also seems that excessive exertion at altitude (e.g. carrying a heavy pack) may predispose some people to altitude illness. So it may be advisable to carry a light pack and use a porter (they are not expensive).</p> <p align="justify"> Acclimatization's the word used to describe the adjustments your body makes as it ascends. You should adjust your schedule so that you average no more than 300 meters per day of ascent above 3,000 meters. If you fail to allow time for acclimatization, you may develop symptoms of AMS. The AMS may be mild enough to go away with a day's rest or if ignored may lead to death. All that is required to ensure a safe trek is basic awareness of AMS, and a willingness to rest or descend if you develop symptoms. As a result of the growing awareness of altitude problems there is only one death from AMS in Nepal out of every 30,000 trekkers. Even these deaths would be avoidable if everyone knew how to respond to AMS. There are no reliable figures for casualties among porters. Recognizing Acute Mountain Sickness</p> <p align="justify"><br /> Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) can develop at any altitude over 2,000 meters. The early symptoms are headache, extreme fatigue, and loss of appetite. Some people become breathless at rest. AMS is the result of fluid accumulating in parts of the body. Where it does not belong: in the brain, in the lungs or both. When mild symptoms develop, it is a signal that you must stay at that altitude until symptoms have gone away. Never ascend with any symptoms of AMS! Usually within one or two days you will feel well and can continue your trek.<br /> If you are resting at the same altitude and your symptoms are becoming worse, then it is necessary to descend. Worsening symptoms of AMS include increasing tiredness, severe headache, vomiting and loss of coordination. There are signs of High Altitude Cerebral Edema of HACE. HACE can lead to unconsciousness and death within 12 hours if progressive symptoms are ignored. Increasing shortness of breath, cough and tiredness are signs of High Altitude Pulmonary Edema or HAPE. HAPE can also be rapidly fatal if ignored.</p> <p align="justify"><br /> A person suffering from AMS may not have clear thinking and may have to be forced to descend. Even if someone is willing to descend they should never be allowed to descend alone. Keep descending until the person shows some sign of improvement, usually after 300-500 meters of descent. Even if the diagnosis is not clear, but might be AMS, you should descend. You can always re-ascend when the person feels better. It is best to start descending while the person who is ill can still walk. If the person can no longer walk, a yak or horse might be obtained. Porters can often be found to carry a sick person down. Do not wait for a helicopter. If you choose to administer oxygen or medications do not delay the descent to watch for improvement.</p> <p align="justify"><br /> In summary, if you are not doing well at altitude, most likely you have some mild symptoms of AMS. Rest at the same altitude until you feel well. If you are getting worse at the same altitude, descend to at least the last point at which you test well. If you are not sure of the diagnosis, err on the side of being too cautious. Remember severe altitude sickness is entirely preventable if you follow these guidelines.</p> <p align="justify"> </p> <h1>Prevention of Altitude Illness:</h1> <ol> <li> Having a sensible itinerary is the most important way to avoid altitude illness. It is recommended to climb not more than 1,000ft (300m) a day above an altitude of 10,000 ft (3,000m). If the terrain is such that this is not possible, one needs to have two rest days e.g. 2 rest days are recommended at Namche Bazaar where 2,000ft (600m) are gained in 1 day from Phakding for most itineraries. Having flexibility with 1-2 extra days built into your schedule will allow you to rest when you are not feeling well and help avoid altitude illness. It also helps to `climb high` and `sleep low`.</li> <li> Use Diamox-which blocks an enzyme in the kidney and makes the blood acidic which is interpreted by the brain as a signal to breathe more. Diamox therefore, enhances the physiological response to altitude by increasing the rate and depth of breathing and it also acts as a mild diuretic. Side effects of the drug are: tingling of fingers and toes and tingling around the mouth. Sulfa allergic individuals are recommended not to take this drug. Prophylactic dose of Diamox is half or one 250mg tablet twice a day. Use of Diamox will not mask the symptoms of altitude illness if it is to occur. Start taking Diamox the day before ascent to 10,000 ft (3,000m), continue it through your ascent to higher altitudes and stop when you start descending.</li> <li> Other preventive strategies such as Gingko Biloba which was once thought to be useful for altitude illness prevention has not been found useful in several studies. Salmeterol (Serevent) inhaler used to treat asthma can help prevent HAPE and may be used by HAPE susceptible people prophylactically. For persons allergic to sulfa drugs and for abrupt ascents, it is possible to use dexamethasone, a very potent steroid drug.<br /> </li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h1>Treatment of Altitude Illness:</h1> <p>For mild symptoms, one can stay at the same altitude to see if symptoms will resolve and ascend when symptoms have resolved completely. Diamox can also be used to treat mild to moderate symptoms. If symptoms persist or worsen at this altitude, descent is required.</p> <p>For severe symptoms of HACE or HAPE, descent must begin immediately whenever feasible. Helicopter evacuation may be essential for descent unless there is rapid improvement with medical treatment and walking down is feasible. Physical exertion even when it is for descent can be detrimental for patients with HAPE. Severe HAPE patients should be carried down if helicopter evacuation is not possible.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Other treatment modalities to help during descent</h3> <ol> <li><strong> Diamox </strong> is generally useful for mild to moderate AMS. Dosage: One 250 mg tablet two or three times a day.</li> <li><strong> Dexamethasone</strong> - is a very potent steroid used in HACE temporarily to facilitate descent. This drug improves the symptoms but does not help acclimatization. It is not recommended to ascend while still taking this drug even if one is symptom free. Dosage: 4 mg every 6 hours.</li> <li><strong> Nifedipine -</strong> is useful in HAPE by lowering pressure in the pulmonary blood vessels and thereby decreasing fluid in the lungs. This drug also lowers blood pressure. Sildenafil (Viagra) is increasingly being used in treating HAPE.</li> <li><strong> Oxygen </strong>- is very useful particularly for HAPE.</li> </ol> <p><br /> </p> <h3>Three golden rules to avoid dying from altitude illness:</h3> <p> </p> <ol> <li>Learn the early symptoms of altitude illness and recognize when you have them. Remember, you may be the only person in a group with symptoms.</li> <li>Never ascend to sleep at a new altitude with any symptoms of AMS.</li> <li>Descend if your symptoms are getting worse while resting at the same altitude.<br /> </li> </ol> <p> </p> </div> <div class="leftcolumn"> <div class="date"> Tuesday, 24 April 2012 </div> <div class="ltmenu"> <h2>Trekking Discussion</h2> <ul> <li> <a href="what_is_trekking.php">What is trekking?</a></li> <li><a href="who_can_trek.php">Who can trek? </a></li> <li> <a href="why-trekking-in-nepal.php">Why trekking in Nepal?</a></li> <li><a href="first_time_trekking.php">First time trekking?</a> </li> <li><a href="trekking_in_reality.php">Trekking in reality </a></li> <li><a href="how_long_when_to_trek.php">How long and when to trek</a></li> <li><a href="asked_questions_answers.php">Asked Questions &amp; Answers</a></li> <li><a href="what_is_tea_house_trekking.php">What is tea house trek?</a></li> <li><a href="what_is_camping_trekking.php">What is camping trek?</a></li> <li><a href="hotel_food_while_trekking.php">Hotel &amp; food while trekking</a></li> <li><a href="trek_planning_check_list.php">Trekking Planning Check List</a></li> <li><a href="trekking_permit.php">Trekking Permit</a> &amp; <a href="trekking_grade.php">Grade</a> </li> <li><a href="trekking_equipments.php">Clothing &amp; Equipments</a></li> <li><a href="health_essential_for_traveling_in_nepal.php">Health Essensial</a> &amp; <a href="altitude_sickness.php">Altitude Sickness</a></li> <li><a href="weather_on_trekking.php">Weather on trekking</a></li> <li><a href="trek_leaders_staffs.php">Trek leaders and Staffs</a></li> <li><a href="transportation_on_trekking.php">Transportation on Trekking</a></li> </ul> </div> <div align="left"></div> <div class="ltmenu"> <h2>Find Special Adventure</h2> <ul> <li><a href="rafting_in_nepal.php">Rafting</a> and <a href="rafting_in_nepal.php">Kayaking</a></li> <li> <a href="nepal_hiking.php">Hiking</a> and <a href="nepal_walking_holidays.php">Walking</a></li> <li><a href="jungle_safari_in_nepal.php">Jungle Safari</a> &amp; <a href="nepal_tour.php">Nepal Tour</a></li> <li><a href="mountain_biking_in_nepal.php"> Mountain biking</a> &amp; Rock climbing</li> <li><a href="peak_climbing.php"> Peak Climbing</a> &amp; <a href="mountaineering.php">Expeditions</a></li> <li><a href="paragliding_nepal.php"> Paragliding</a> &amp; <a href="mountain_flight.php">Everest Flights</a> </li> <li><a href="bungy_jumping.php"> Bungy Jumping </a> &amp; <a href="sightseeing_in_nepal.php">Sightseeing Tour </a></li> <li><a href="hotel_booking.php">Hotel Booking</a> &amp; <a href="nepal_air_ticketing.php">Air Ticketing</a> </li> <li><a href="car-rental-in-nepal.php">Car Rental</a> &amp; Helicopter Charter</li> </ul> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> <div class="footer"> <div class="footerlinks"> <a href="./">Home</a> | <a href="contact_us.php">Contact Us</a> | <a href="booking_form.php">Online Booking</a> | <a href="FAQs.php">FAQs</a> | <a href="why_travel_with_us.php">Why Travel with Us?</a> | <a href="booking_terms_conditions.php">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> | <a href="how-to-book-trekking-tour-trip.php">How to Book trip?</a> | <a href="http://www.nepalguidetrek.com" title="Trekking in Nepal">Trekking in Nepal</a> | <a href="site_map.php">Sitemap </a>| <a href="links.php">Resources</a> </div> <p>Copyright &copy; 2007-2012, Above The Himalaya Trekking (P) Ltd..

This is part of an ongoing series of hubs that depicts the role and importance of pollinators.</p> <p>The Importance of Flowering Plants &amp; Fruit:</p> <p>The reproductive cycle of flowering plants and fruit is important to everyone. Flowering plants and fruit make up one third or more of the diet that humans consume globally. The impact of this statement is made more dramatic when one considers that flowering plants and fruit make up ONE of our THREE square meals we are supposed to consume each day. If the impact of flowering plants and fruit is truly considered than it would be prudent to include them as food sources for other animals that play a role in food consumption for humans. Without flowering plants and fruit, cattle would starve, sheep would have nothing to graze, etc. etc. etc. We as humans are very dependent upon flowering plants and fruit; but, we are not the only creatures that depend on the bountiful harvests of flowering plants and fruit for food.</p> <p>To delve into the role that plants play in our food chain would be a tremendous undertaking. Suffice to say that without flowering plants and fruit mankind would probably be extinct as would many of the other creatures that roam the earth. The creatures that were left would be highly specialized.</p> </div> </div> <div id="mod_15408207" class="module moduleText color0"> <h2 class="subtitle">What is a Flowering Plant or Fruit?</h2> <div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_15408207"> <p>Flowering Plants and Fruit:</p> <p>By definition, flowering plants and fruit are a group of plants that bears flowers and fruit as means of reproduction. Scientifically, a flowering plant or fruit is any member of the species of angiosperms. Angiosperms are a very large family of plant that contain more then 250,000 individual specimens. We say more then, because there are many species of plants that have not yet been found or named. </p> </div> </div> <div id="mod_15408208" class="module moduleImage"> <h2 class="subtitle">Flowering Plants and Fruit By Definition:</h2> <div id="imgs_15408208"> <div id="img_url_5352813"> <img src="http://s2.hubimg.com/u/5352813_f520.jpg" width="520" height="390" class="full" alt="This photo of a bean plant shows the blossoms, fruit an pre-fruit of the bean reproductive cycle." title="This photo of a bean plant shows the blossoms, fruit an pre-fruit of the bean reproductive cycle." /> </div> <div class="caption_full" id="img_desc_5352813"> This photo of a bean plant shows the blossoms, fruit an pre-fruit of the bean reproductive cycle. </div> </div> </div> <div id="mod_15408210" class="module moduleText color0"> <h2 class="subtitle">How Do Plants Reproduce?</h2> <div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_15408210"> <p>How Do Plants Reproduce?</p> <p>Plants reproduce either sexually or asexually. An example of a form of asexual reproduction in plants would be a plant that produced another plant without the use of seeds. A strawberry plant is a plant that produces both sexually and asexually. We have all seen the tiny seeds on a strawberry; however, a strawberry plant will also send off a runner that forms another plant. This is an example of asexual reproduction in plants. Another form of asexual reproduction in plants would be rhizomes. Bermuda Grass, for example reproduces by runner, rhizome and by seed. A rhizome is an underground horizontal root that is capable of producing a root ball of its own and shoots from a node. If separated from the host plant, the rhizome would become a plant in its own right.</p> <p>The focus of this hub is about how plants reproduce sexually, because most of the plants we eat reproduce by sexual reproduction. It is that very act of sexual reproduction that produces food for humans and other creatures. The fruit of the act is what we harvest. This may be a tomato or a squash or even coffee beans. The list of food we gather and harvest from flowering plants and fruit is very long. Sexual reproduction in plants involves both female and male sexual organs. Flowers often contain both male and female sexual organs. In some cases, flowers may produce male flowers and female flowers. In other cases, a plant may only produce male or female flowers but not both. Squash plants are an example of plants that make female and male flowers. Avocado trees are an example of a plant that makes either male or female flowers, but not both.</p> <p></p> </div> </div> <div id="mod_15408209" class="module moduleImage"> <h2 class="subtitle">Strawberry with Visible Seeds:</h2> <div id="imgs_15408209"> <div id="img_url_5352836"> <img src="http://s1.hubimg.com/u/5352836_f520.jpg" width="520" height="390" class="full" alt="This ripe strawberry presents its viable seeds on the outside of the fruit.

They primarily rely on pollinators to move the pollen from the male stamen to the female pistil. In some cases, plants can reproduce using wind or rain but the primary method by which the pollen moves from the stamen to the pistil is by pollinator. A pollinator is usually an insect such as a bee or small animals or even birds. A hummingbird is an example of a bird that helps to pollinate plants.</p> <p>The basic process works like this: Pollinators gather nectar from flowers regardless of the sex of the flower. During this process the pollen on the male stamen sticks to the pollinator and as the pollinator continues its search for nectar, it transfers the pollen from the male stamen to the female pistil where it sticks to the stigma. The pollen then travels from the stigma to the style and down into the ovary where it mixes with the female DNA and forms a seed.</p> <p>This process is very critical for flowering plants and fruit. How effective this process is can be seen in the outcome of crop yields. While there are other factors that go into crop yield, pollination is essential. Fruit can actually abort if there is not enough pollen exchange to pollinate enough of the female ova. This is a good example of why pollinators are so important to plant reproduction.</p> <p></p> </div> </div> <div id="mod_15408516" class="module moduleImage"> <h2 class="subtitle">This is a Honey Bee At work.

Flowering plants and fruit reproduce sexually and asexually. Sexual reproduction in flowering plants and fruit translates directly into food for most creatures on earth. Sexual reproduction in flowering plants and fruit requires the use of pollinators. In a smaller number of cases, pollination can occur by wind or rain. Flowering plants and fruit make up one third of man-kinds food source. The interdependent relationship between humans, flowering plants and fruit and pollinators is a matter of survival for everything involved. Without pollinators, flowering plants and fruit would not reproduce and humans would lose a great portion of daily food intake. </p> </div> </div> <div id="mod_15408515" class="module moduleImage"> <h2 class="subtitle">Berries, Fruit and Vegetables Are The End Result of Pollination:</h2> <div id="imgs_15408515"> <div id="img_url_5352908"> <img src="http://s1.hubimg.com/u/5352908_f520.jpg" width="520" height="390" class="full" alt="" title="" /> </div> <div class="caption_full" id="img_desc_5352908"> </div> </div> </div> <div id="mod_new11" class="module moduleAdSpot color0"> <div style="padding-bottom:5px"> <script type="text/javascript">GA_googleFillSlot("knowledge_hub_share_520x200");</script> </div> </div> <div id="mod_new7" class="module moduleShare color0"> <script src="http://cdn.printfriendly.com/printfriendly.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <div id="share_tgt"></div> <p class="flags"><span id="rec_2617948"><a class="button green_bg" style="width:72px" href="#" onclick="return recArt(2617948, 1);"><span class="icon up white"></span>vote up</a><a class="button red_bg" style="width:72px" href="#" onclick="return recArt(2617948, 0);"><span class="icon down white"></span>vote down</a></span><a class="button dark_grey_bg" href="#" onclick="toggleShareIt(2617948, true,false);return false;"><span class="icon facebook white"></span>share</a><a class="button grey_bg" href="#" id="printnicer" onclick="window.print(); return false;" title="Print an optimized version of this web page"><span class="icon print white"></span>print</a><a class="button grey_bg" onclick="return showFlagHub(2617948);" href="#"><span class="icon flag white"></span>flag</a></p> <div class="hub_praise"> <span id="praise_feedback">Was this Hub ...?</span> <ul> <li id="praise_item_1"><a href="#" onclick="return praiseHub(2617948, 1);">Useful</a> (1)</li> <li id="praise_item_2"><a href="#" onclick="return praiseHub(2617948, 2);">Funny</a> </li> <li id="praise_item_3"><a href="#" onclick="return praiseHub(2617948, 3);">Awesome</a> (1)</li> <li id="praise_item_4"><a href="#" onclick="return praiseHub(2617948, 4);">Beautiful</a> </li> <li id="praise_item_5"><a href="#" onclick="return praiseHub(2617948, 5);">Interesting</a> (3)</li> </ul> </div> <div class="group_nav"> <div id="leftGroupnav"> <a href="http://davenmidtown.hubpages.com/hub/Organic-Gardening-Growing-Gardens-In-Smaller-Spaces"><span class="mainsprite leftnav"></span>Organic Gardening: Organic Gardening - Growing Gardens In Smaller Spaces</a> </div> <div id="rightGroupnav"> <a href="http://davenmidtown.hubpages.com/hub/Strawberry-Pots-Planting-Kitchen-Herbs">Organic Gardening: Strawberry Pots: Planting Kitchen Herbs<span class="mainsprite rightnav"></span></a> </div> </div> </div> <div id="comFirst"></div> <div id="mod_15408206" class="module moduleComment"> <h2 class="subtitle">Comments<span class="follow_article follow_article_2617948" id="" style="float: right"><a class="follow_button">Loading...</a></span> <script type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[ jQuery(document).ready(function() { var typeId = 2; var objectId = 2617948; var overrides = []; updateFollowButton( typeId, objectId, true, overrides ); });// ]]> </script></h2> <div> <a class="jumplink" href="#lastcomment">Go to last comment</a> </div> <div class="comment dwarfCommenter starCommenter authorComment" id="comment6112251"> <div class="author_photo"> <a href="http://davenmidtown.hubpages.com/"><img src="http://s4.hubimg.com/u/5838139_50.jpg" alt="davenmidtown profile image" title="davenmidtown profile image" /></a> </div> <p class="comment_meta"><strong><a href="http://davenmidtown.hubpages.com/">davenmidtown</a>&nbsp;</strong><small>Hub Author</small> 9 months ago </p> <p>I think I will need to redo these diagrams so that people can read them.</p> </div> <div class="comment dwarfCommenter starCommenter authorComment" id="comment6113343"> <div class="author_photo"> <a href="http://davenmidtown.hubpages.com/"><img src="http://s4.hubimg.com/u/5838139_50.jpg" alt="davenmidtown profile image" title="davenmidtown profile image" /></a> </div> <p class="comment_meta"><strong><a href="http://davenmidtown.hubpages.com/">davenmidtown</a>&nbsp;</strong><small>Hub Author</small> 8 months ago </p> <p>Much Better: Enjoy!</p> </div> <div class="comment dwarfCommenter starCommenter" id="comment6120387"> <div class="author_photo"> <a href="http://moviemaster.hubpages.com/"><img src="http://s3.hubimg.com/u/6549134_50.jpg" alt="Movie Master profile image" title="Movie Master profile image" /></a> </div> <p class="comment_meta"><strong><a href="http://moviemaster.hubpages.com/">Movie Master</a>&nbsp;</strong><small>Level 8 Commenter</small> 8 months ago </p> <p>Brilliant hub, bursting with information and well written.

The larger, triangular look makes it a perfect necktie knot for modern Italian design neckties, and for shirts with wide spread collars. <br /></p> <h2>Double Windsor Tie Knot Instructions:</h2> <img src="images/windsor.jpg" alt="uniform tie how to tie a double windsor tie knot graph" width="796" height="194" /> <ol> <li>To tie a Windsor knot, start by flipping up your collars and placing the necktie around your neck. The double Windsor knot is a larger tie knot and it will require more of the tie’s length. For that reason make sure to leave the wide part of the necktie hanging much lower than the narrow end.</li> <li>Place the wide end of the tie over the narrow end, and pull it behind, and then back over the part of the necktie coming from your collar. Then pull the wide part of the necktie back behind the narrow end as show by the red arrow in picture #2. Tip: Hold the narrow end with one hand slightly tight. This will help you to keep the half finished necktie knot in place and slightly tightened.</li> <li>Now do the same thing on the other side of the necktie. Doing this will create the popular symmetrical look of the Double Windsor knot.</li> <li>Now pull the wide end of the necktie over the narrow end and create a loop. Hold the top open with one hand while holding the half finished double Windsor knot in place.</li> <li>Pull the wide end of the necktie through the loop.</li> <li>Tighten the double Windsor knot, flip down the collars, and adjust the double Windsor knot so that the knot lies centered between the collars.<br /> </li> </ol>� <h2>Matching a Double Windsor Tie knot:</h2> <p>The double Windsor tie knot is one of the larger tie knots and therefore best suited with shirts that have a wide spread collar. The best necktie designs are classic and modern <a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/">restaurant uniform ties</a>, as bowties are less likely to get dirty than neckties. If you still prefer the look of neckties to the bow tie, than <a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/italian-designer-neckties.php">Italian Silk Ties</a>. If you are tall and/or have a larger collar size you might have difficulty tying the double Windsor tie knot tie the right length. Chances are you might need Extra Long Ties, or try tying the smaller <a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/how-to-tie-a-half-windsor-knot.php">half Windsor knot</a>. <br /></p> <div id="abhaenger"> Tying neckties with the double Windsor tie knot, learn how to tie a Windsor knot, Full Windsor necktie knot, double Windsor neck tie knot. </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> <!--#content--> <div id="footer"> <div style="width:250px;margin-left:10px;"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">Copyright</span> <br />2012 United e Commerce </div> <div style="width:450px;text-align:center;"> Service Links <br /> <a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/contact_us.php">Contact Us</a> | <!--<a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/testimonials.php">Customer Testimonials</a> | --> <a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/privacy-policy.php">Privacy Policy |</a> <a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/shipping.php">Shipping</a> </div> <div style="width:900px;text-align:center;margin-left:35px;"> <a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/Siena-ties-assortment-170.html">Italian Silk Ties</a>, <a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/stain-resistant-neckties.php">Stain Resistant Ties</a>, <a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/solid-color-ties.php">Solid Color Ties</a>, <a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/striped-business-neckties.php">Business Neckties</a>, <a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/restaurant-neckties.php">Waiter Neckties</a>, <a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/bow-ties.php">Uniform Bow Ties</a>, <a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/custom-designed-neckties.php">Custom designed neckties</a>, <a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/marketing-pr-companies.php">Company neckties</a>, <a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/neckties-trade-shows-events.php">Trade Show Neckties</a>, <a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/wedding-neckties.php">Event Neckties</a>, <a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/catering-services.php">Service Neckties</a>, <a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/pocket-squares.php">Pocket Squares</a>, <a href="http://www.uniform-ties.com/school-uniforms-neckties.php">School Uniform Ties</a> </div> </div> </div> <!--wrap-oben--> </div> <!--wrap--> </body> </html>

This dream involved a hole in the road that they knew they had to avoid.&nbsp; In fact, in the dream, they were aware of the fact that falling in the hole meant certain death.</p> <p>The funny thing was, they could see into the hole and it was only about a foot deep and beautiful yellow flowers were on the bottom!&nbsp; The dreamer wondered why such a shallow, innocent looking hole would elicit such fear in the dream.&nbsp; As he/she pointed out, “… the thing that had me so frightened during the dream, and even after I first woke up, seems silly now. It looked like a flower bed that had sunk about a foot!”&nbsp; However, the dreamer also mentioned that this was actually one of the worst <a title="Nightmares" href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/category/dreams/nightmares/">nightmares</a> they’d had in a long time and that they woke up “frightened” and “breathing heavily.”</p> <p>While it may seem that avoiding the hole would have been easy, the hole in the dream was on a very narrow road that the dreamer HAD to travel on.&nbsp; They simply HAD to get past the hole without falling in.&nbsp; <a title="Dreams" href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com">Dreams</a> are amazing like that, we just KNOW something but most dreamers have no idea where the knowledge stems from.&nbsp; What makes these dreams even more fascinating is the fact that the knowledge does stem from someplace… the dreamer’s subconsciousness.&nbsp; Which is, of course, why <a title="Dream Interpretation" href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/category/dream-interpretation/">dream interpretation</a> is so important and fascinating – our dreams truly do let us know what’s going on deep in our minds and hearts.</p> <p>In the dream of the hole in the road, the dreamer KNEW that the innocent-looking hole was deadly.&nbsp; While this may be a bit extreme for what lies in their day to day world, make no mistake about it:&nbsp; There is something in their life that spells trouble.&nbsp; Whether it’s a relationship, hobbies, a goal, plans, job, etc…&nbsp; There is something that, <em>while on the surface seems innocent (as lovely perhaps as a flower bed)</em>, could spell disaster.&nbsp; Deep in the dreamer’s subconsciousness, they know it.</p> <p>The thing about this dream that worries me most is how the dreamer felt during the dream and upon waking.&nbsp; So much about a dream’s interpretation lies in how the dreamer felt (or feels).&nbsp; The intensity of the feelings indicates that the potential danger that lies within the dreamer’s real life isn’t something they should play around with.&nbsp; When our dreams are this intense and bring about such strong emotions and feelings, make no mistake about it, our subconscious mind REALLY wants us to listen!</p> <p>Of course, changes in our lives shouldn’t be made on the grounds of a dream alone.&nbsp; The dream should serve as a reason to look more closely at what’s going on in our lives.</p> <p>If you’ve ever had a <a title="Dream" href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com">dream</a> about a hole in the road (or along your path) that you were afraid of falling in, realize that it’s symbolic of something in your life – something that you’re afraid of “falling into” or “falling prey to.”</p> <p>Some people, who have recently quit smoking, will have <strong>hole dreams</strong>.&nbsp; The dream symbolism is that they’re afraid of falling back into a harmful habit.&nbsp; Many times, realizing that their subconscious mind fears for their well-being is JUST the extra incentive they need to avoid the pitfalls while awake as surely as they do in their dream.</p> <p><em>Have you ever personally had hole dreams.&nbsp; Do you realize what the hole in the dream symbolized?&nbsp; Share your dream and experiences in the comments!</em></p> <p><strong>Dream Prophesy is now on Facebook!

Adults often feel helpless when it comes to dealing with a child’s nightmares.&nbsp; It helps to keep a few ideas in mind:</p> <ol> <li>Never, ever brush off or dismiss a child’s fears.&nbsp; When you say, “Oh, that’s nothing, you’re being silly,” you are insulting the child as well as diminishing their concerns.&nbsp; If they are legitimately frightened, it’s far from “nothing” and they aren’t being “silly,” they’re being children.</li> <li>You don’t want to blow the nightmare or the dream up larger than they should be, of course, but you should listen to the child as she or he tells you what happened in the dream.</li> <li>Instead of saying, “Monsters don’t exist!” – ask the child if he/she has ever seen a monster.&nbsp; Tell them that you haven’t either (which will carry a great deal of weight, since the child probably thinks you’re about as old as old gets!).&nbsp; Allow them to come to the realization that it was just a dream and that monsters (or whatever) really don’t exist.&nbsp; Stay calm, casual, and never tease or make fun of them.</li> <li>Help them&nbsp; understand that dreams are like little movies our brain creates to entertain itself while we’re asleep.&nbsp; Tell them that, apparently, their mind thought it was time for a scary movie and that it will probably want to create a comedy next.&nbsp; Let them know that watching several cartoons (lighthearted) before bedtime the next night will probably encourage their brain to keep things funny!</li> <li>If the child is afraid to go back to sleep, ask yourself this question:&nbsp; “If you were their age and felt totally afraid of your dreams and the dark, what would you want your mom or dad to do?”&nbsp;&nbsp; You’d want them to let you stay awake for the time being – with the lights on!&nbsp; If you try to force them to go back to a frightening place, you aren’t going to be much of a hero, are you?</li> </ol> <p>Nightmares are a part of growing up, so are “monsters under the bed” and “creepers in the closet.”&nbsp; Just try to be as calm and reassuring as you can and you’ll help them disappear soon.</p> <p><span class="st_facebook" st_title="When Children Experience Nightmares" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/when-children-experience-nightmares/"></span><span class="st_twitter" st_title="When Children Experience Nightmares" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/when-children-experience-nightmares/"></span><span class="st_email" st_title="When Children Experience Nightmares" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/when-children-experience-nightmares/"></span><span class="st_sharethis" st_title="When Children Experience Nightmares" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/when-children-experience-nightmares/"></span></p> </div> <!-- end .entry-content --> <div class="post-meta"> <span class="categories">Filed Under: <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/category/dreams/nightmares/" title="View all posts in Nightmares" rel="category tag">Nightmares</a></span> &middot;

It’ll let you know where we came from, where we are, and where we’re headed! </strong></em></p> <p><strong>Here’s the first submitted dream we’ve received since the relaunch of Dream Prophesy:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>“I have a recurring dream that I desperately need help understanding.&nbsp; Each dream has knives in it.&nbsp; In the first one, my son wanted to play his guitar but couldn’t find it.&nbsp; He opened the closet and a huge knife fell on him.&nbsp; Blood was everywhere and we were screaming.&nbsp; Then I woke up.</p> <p>In the second dream, I was cooking supper and cut my hand off with a butter knife!&nbsp; The third dream was just about the same, except it was a steak knife and it cut off part of my plate.</p> <p>These dreams are getting to me, especially the one about my son. I’m scared of what the next dream will be about and who will get hurt in it.&nbsp; Please help and thank you.”</p> </blockquote> <p>I can see how these dreams would trouble you. The first thing you need to do is to remind yourself that these dreams aren’t prophetic. They aren’t signaling an accident or anything bad ahead. Dreams deal with what HAS happened, what IS happening, and your emotions and feelings. Some of these emotions and feelings the dreamer is fully aware of. Others, the dreamer doesn’t seem to be aware of whatsoever.</p> <p>When I hear about people dreaming of knives, my first reaction is this: There’s something in their life that they want to remove, or “cut out.” These could include:</p> <ul> <li>A bad habit.&nbsp; Smokers who want to quit smoking often dream of knives.&nbsp; Their desire to “cut out” this habit weighs on their mind and presents itself in their dream world.</li> <li>Wanting to lose weight.&nbsp; Wanting to lose extra weight will also lead to knife dreams.</li> <li>Dislike of an annoying co-worker, fellow student, neighbor, or even family member.&nbsp; The dreamer doesn’t (of course!) want to harm this annoying person – but they wouldn’t mind AT ALL if fate cut them out of their life and put them in someone else’s!</li> <li>A desire to leave your job, school, home, community, etc.&nbsp; Wanting to separate yourself from a current situation or place can lead to knife dreams.</li> <li>A thought or feeling.&nbsp; Sometimes we feel things we wish we didn’t feel or keep having thoughts we wish would go away.&nbsp; We think, “Why don’t I just cut it out?! ” – But we seem unable to.</li> </ul> <p>All of the above are instances that can lead to these types of dreams.&nbsp; When it comes to recurring dreams, more times than not, fully realizing WHY you’re having the dreams is enough to send them packing.&nbsp; Even if you haven’t arrived at the solution yet,&nbsp; your subconscious mind seems perfectly content with you just knowing the situation exists.</p> <p>I truly hope this helps!</p> <p>Thanks so much for submitting your dream.&nbsp; I’ve learned from experience (from the last time the site was up&nbsp; BEFORE disaster struck!) that people are greatly helped when they read other people’s dreams.&nbsp; So, know that you’ve helped others simply by sharing your dream.</p> <p><em>“Dreams are road signs along the nighttime highway of sleep.”</em> – Astrid Alauda</p> <p><span class="st_facebook" st_title="Dream Analysis – A Dream Interpretation" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/dream-analysis-a-dream-interpretation/"></span><span class="st_twitter" st_title="Dream Analysis – A Dream Interpretation" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/dream-analysis-a-dream-interpretation/"></span><span class="st_email" st_title="Dream Analysis – A Dream Interpretation" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/dream-analysis-a-dream-interpretation/"></span><span class="st_sharethis" st_title="Dream Analysis – A Dream Interpretation" st_url="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/dream-analysis-a-dream-interpretation/"></span></p> </div> <!-- end .entry-content --> <div class="post-meta"> <span class="categories">Filed Under: <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/category/dream-analysis/" title="View all posts in Dream Analysis" rel="category tag">Dream Analysis</a>, <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/category/dream-interpretation/" title="View all posts in Dream Interpretation" rel="category tag">Dream Interpretation</a>, <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/category/dreams/nightmares/" title="View all posts in Nightmares" rel="category tag">Nightmares</a></span> &middot; <span class="tags">Tagged: <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/tag/knife-dreams/" rel="tag">knife dreams</a>, <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/tag/nightmares/" rel="tag">Nightmares</a>, <a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/tag/recurring-dreams/" rel="tag">recurring dreams</a></span> </div> </div> <!-- end .postclass --> <div class="post-41 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-daydreams category-dream-interpretation category-nightmares tag-daydreams tag-dream-prophesy tag-nightmares tag-troubling-dreams"> <h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/dream-prophesy-nightmares-troubling-dreams-and-daydreams/" title="Dream Prophesy – Nightmares, Troubling Dreams, and Daydreams" rel="bookmark">Dream Prophesy – Nightmares, Troubling Dreams, and Daydreams</a></h2> <div class="post-info"> <span class="date published time" title="2009-03-14T23:34:59+00:00">March 14, 2009</span> by <span class="author vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/author/admin/" class="fn n" title="Joi" rel="author">Joi</a></span></span> &middot; <span class="post-comments"><a href="http://www.dreamprophesy.com/dream-prophesy-nightmares-troubling-dreams-and-daydreams/#comments">3 Comments</a></span> </div> <div class="entry-content"> <p>You may be one of those people who attach meaning to each and every dream, putting each and every dream detail under a microscope combing for the meanings in each. Or, you may disregard your dream(s) immediately upon wakening.</p> <p>As a realistic dreamologist, I’d say that the happiest, sanest place is somewhere between the two illustrations above. No, you don’t have to over-obsess over EVERY detail of EVERY dream, but to totally dismiss your dreams is <em>thisclose</em> to foolish.</p> <p>The subconscious mind is like a treasure trove filled with thoughts, hopes, dreams, fears and insights. Many of these are alien to our conscious mind, which is often far too busy to dwell on such transcendent thoughts. However, while we are asleep, the lid of the treasure trove can swing open, allowing all the gems to roll out!</p> <p>If we would get more in touch with what our own unconscious minds are trying to tell us, who knows what all we could accomplish! Below are a few examples of how our dreams can help us.</p> <p><strong>Troubled Minds and Troubled Dreams:</strong> If you begin dreaming what we term “troubling dreams”, you might want to take a long, hard look <em>inwardly</em>. More likely than not, you are more troubled by recent events or circumstances than you may realize. Troubling dreams are dreams in which, <em>while you don’t experience tragedy or sorrow</em>, you are aggravated, annoyed and mentally tormented by something or someone. A few examples of troubling dreams would be misplacing something important, driving in circles unable to find your way, being wrongly accused of something, etc. They’re grating annoyances that aren’t nightmares but are far from being pleasant.</p> <p><strong>Nightmares: </strong> Nightmares are not always indicative of a mind in turmoil. Medications, stress, and even spicy food can cause outrageous dreams. Some people experience the worst dreams if they eat too closely to bedtime. However, over half the time a nightmare is a result of having too much on your mind. Think of a small wind-up toy car. If you wind it the perfect amount, all goes smoothly. If you over wind, it basically goes amok. The same can be said for our psyches. If we are putting too much on our proverbial plate….our unconscious mind runs amok.</p> <p><strong>Hidden Meanings and Symbols: </strong> Our dreams speak their own language, primarily using symbols and codes. Once you know the meanings and interpretations, you can decode what it is your unconscious mind is trying to tell you.</p> <p>Dream Prophesy is a website which is devoted to the world of dreams. You will find an ever growing collection of articles dealing with dream interpretations, dream symbols, dream analysis, and dream meanings. There will also be a great many articles dealing with the world of sleep – how to achieve greater sleep, the benefits of sleep, etc.</p> <p>You’ll also find an area that’s often gravely overlooked:&nbsp; <strong>Daydreams!</strong> Daydreams carry an unbelievable amount of insight into our subconscious thoughts, feelings, and desires.&nbsp; You will be amazed how much we can learn about ourselves simply</p> <p>The wisest person is the person who is always looking for ways to grow. They never settle for good enough and would never claim to “have arrived”. They will always keep growing and learning, because it’s the only way they know how to live.</p> <p>Dream analysis is simply another avenue to take on this trip we call self-discovery.</p> <p><em>“Dreams are free therapy.
